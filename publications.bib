	abstract = {Current commercially available robotic minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) platforms provide no haptic feedback of tool interactions with the surgical environment. As a consequence, novice robotic surgeons must rely exclusively on visual feedback to sense their physical interactions with the surgical environment. This technical limitation can make it challenging and time-consuming to train novice surgeons to proficiency in RMIS. Extensive prior research has demonstrated that incorporating haptic feedback is effective at improving surgical training task performance. However, few studies have investigated the utility of providing feedback of multiple modalities of haptic feedback simultaneously (multi-modality haptic feedback) in this context, and these studies have presented mixed results regarding its efficacy. Furthermore, the inability to generalize and compare these mixed results has limited our ability to understand why they can vary significantly between studies. Therefore, we have developed a generalized, modular multi-modality haptic feedback and data acquisition framework leveraging the real-time data acquisition and streaming capabilities of the Robot Operating System (ROS). In our preliminary study using this system, participants complete a peg transfer task using a da Vinci robot while receiving haptic feedback of applied forces, contact accelerations, or both via custom wrist-worn haptic devices. Results highlight the capability of our system in running systematic comparisons between various single and dual-modality haptic feedback approaches.},

	abstract = {While the traditional control of surgical robots relies on fully manual teleoperations, human-robot collaborative systems promise to address issues such as workspace constrains and laborious tasks. In particular, shared control can reduce the surgeon’s workload and improve the overall surgical performance by supporting the surgeon effort during movements while keeping them in charge of complex control phases. In this letter, we propose a segmentation of the bimanual peg transfer task that alternates manual and autonomous control correspondingly. The authority allocation in this shared control framework considers both the limitation of learning-based methods and the higher dexterity of humans during physical interaction. The motion and strategies are transferred from an expert human to a da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) using an epsilon-greedy on a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. The model generated enables to train an intelligent agent that can skillfully collaborate with the human operator during the surgical task. The proposed shared control framework is veriﬁed both on a virtual platform and then on a real dVRK to assess its usability and robustness. The results show that, compared to traditional teleoperation, our method can achieve faster and more consistent peg transfers. An analysis of the participants’ effort also reveals a signiﬁcantly lower perception of the workload.},

We think of the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that is expressible as a linear combination of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the task demonstrated by the expert. Our algorithm is based on using “inverse reinforcement learning” to try to recover the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even though we may never recover the expert’s reward function, the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance close to that of the expert, where here performance is measured with respect to the expert’s unknown reward function.},

	abstract = {In the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) standard medical training regimen, the Pattern Cutting task requires residents to demonstrate proﬁciency by maneuvering two tools, surgical scissors and tissue gripper, to accurately cut a circular pattern on surgical gauze suspended at the corners. Accuracy of cutting depends on tensioning, wherein the gripper pinches a point on the gauze in R3 and pulls to induce and maintain tension in the material as cutting proceeds. An automated tensioning policy maps the current state of the gauze to output a direction of pulling as an action. The optimal tensioning policy depends on both the choice of pinch point and cutting trajectory. We explore the problem of learning a tensioning policy conditioned on speciﬁc cutting trajectories. Every timestep, we allow the gripper to react to the deformation of the gauze and progress of the cutting trajectory with a translation unit vector along an allowable set of directions. As deformation is difﬁcult to analytically model and explicitly observe, we leverage deep reinforcement learning with direct policy search methods to learn tensioning policies using a ﬁniteelement simulator and then transfer them to a physical system. We compare the Deep RL tensioning policies with ﬁxed and analytic (opposing the error vector with a ﬁxed pinch point) policies on a set of 17 open and closed curved contours in simulation and 4 patterns in physical experiments with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Our simulation results suggest that learning to tension with Deep RL can signiﬁcantly improve performance and robustness to noise and external forces.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot’s visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 12 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9\%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models. Code, data, and training details will be publicly available.},

Deep reinforcement learning methods can remove the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still require a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning holds the promise of automatic reward acquisition, but has proven exceptionally difficult to apply to large, high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. In this work, we propose adverserial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), a practical and scalable inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on an adversarial reward learning formulation. We demonstrate that AIRL is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in dynamics, enabling us to learn policies even under significant variation in the environment seen during training. Our experiments show that AIRL greatly outperforms prior methods in these transfer settings.},

We explore how inverse optimal control (IOC) can be used to learn behaviors from demonstrations, with applications to torque control of high-dimensional robotic systems. Our method addresses two key challenges in inverse optimal control: first, the need for informative features and effective regularization to impose structure on the cost, and second, the difficulty of learning the cost function under unknown dynamics for high-dimensional continuous systems. To address the former challenge, we present an algorithm capable of learning arbitrary nonlinear cost functions, such as neural networks, without meticulous feature engineering. To address the latter challenge, we formulate an efficient sample-based approximation for MaxEnt IOC. We evaluate our method on a series of simulated tasks and real-world robotic manipulation problems, demonstrating substantial improvement over prior methods both in terms of task complexity and sample efficiency.},

	abstract = {While visual imitation learning offers one of the most effective ways of learning from visual demonstrations, generalizing from them requires either hundreds of diverse demonstrations, task specific priors, or large, hard-to-train parametric models. One reason such complexities arise is because standard visual imitation frameworks try to solve two coupled problems at once: learning a succinct but good representation from the diverse visual data, while simultaneously learning to associate the demonstrated actions with such representations. Such joint learning causes an interdependence between these two problems, which often results in needing large amounts of demonstrations for learning. To address this challenge, we instead propose to decouple representation learning from behavior learning for visual imitation. First, we learn a visual representation encoder from offline data using standard supervised and self-supervised learning methods. Once the representations are trained, we use non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression to predict the actions. We experimentally show that this simple decoupling improves the performance of visual imitation models on both offline demonstration datasets and real-robot door opening compared to prior work in visual imitation.

This innovative use of MRI devices allows exerting magnetic pulling forces on untethered magnetic robots, which could be used for navigation, diagnosis, drug delivery and therapeutic procedures inside a human body. So far, MRI-powered untethered magnetic robots lack simultaneous position and orientation control inside three-dimensional (3D) fluids, and therefore, their control has been limited to 3-DoF position control. In this paper, we present a path-planning-based 5-DoF control algorithm to steer and control an MRI-powered untethered robot's position and orientation simultaneously in 3D workspaces in fluids. Eventhough the simulation results show that the proposed optimal controller can successfully control the robot for 5-DoF, in the experiments, we observe a reduced 5-DoF controllability due to the robot manufacturing errors, which result in pitch angle to remain at around the neutral pitching angle at the steady state. The proposed controller was evaluated to track four different paths (linear, planar-horizontal, planar-vertical and 3D paths) generated by 3D Bezier curves. The worst-case path-tracking error was observed for 3D path-following experiments. For this case, the position-tracking error was 2.7±1.8 mm, and the orientation-tracking error was 13.5± 28.7 and 3.7± 10.2 degrees for yaw and pitch angles, respectively. The overall path is completed within 19.6 seconds with 23.6 mm overall displacement and 61.2 and 41.2 degrees of yaw and pitch angle rotation, respectively.

However, the vast majority of these small-scale robots have very limited manipulation capabilities, and none of the steering systems currently available enables humans to intuitively and effectively control dexterous miniaturized robots in a remote environment. In this paper, we present an innovative microteleoperation system with haptic assistance for the intuitive steering and control of miniaturized self-folding soft magnetic grippers in 2-D space. The soft grippers can be wirelessly positioned using weak magnetic fields and opened/closed by changing their temperature. An image-guided algorithm tracks the position of the controlled miniaturized gripper in the remote environment. A haptic interface provides the human operator with compelling haptic sensations about the interaction between the gripper and the environment as well as enables the operator to intuitively control the target position and grasping configuration of the gripper. Finally, magnetic and thermal control systems regulate the position and grasping configuration of the gripper. The viability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two experiments involving 26 human subjects. Providing haptic stimuli elicited statistically significant improvements in the performance of the considered navigation and micromanipulation tasks.Note to Practitioners - The ability to accurately and intuitively control the motion of miniaturized grippers in remote environments can open new exciting possibilities in the fields of minimally invasive surgery, micromanipulation, biopsy, and drug delivery. This paper presents a microteleoperation system with haptic assistance through which a clinician can easily control the motion and open/close capability of miniaturized wireless soft grippers. It introduces the underlying autonomous magnetic and thermal control systems, their interconnection with the master haptic interface, and an extensive evaluation in two real-world scenarios: 1) following of a predetermined trajectory and 2) pick-and-place task of a microscopic object.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Magnet-assisted surgery is a new platform within minimally invasive surgery. The Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System, the first magnetic surgical system to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, includes a deployable, magnetic grasper and an external magnet that is used to manipulate the grasper within the peritoneal cavity. This system is currently approved for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a body mass index (BMI) between 21 and 34 kg/m 2 . Herein, we detail the first United States experience with the Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: The Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System was used on consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our institution from June 2016 through November 2016. Only patients undergoing elective surgery and those with a body mass index (BMI) between 21 and 34 kg/m 2 were included. Baseline patient characteristics, operative time, and perioperative details were collected. Results: A total of ten patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System during the defined study period. The mean age at the time of surgery was 49.0 years and the average BMI of the cohort was 27.6 kg/m 2 . The average operative time was 64.4 min. There were no perioperative complications. Seven (70.0\%) patients were discharged to home on the day of surgery, while the remaining three (30.0\%) patients were discharged to home on postoperative day number one. Surgeons reported that the magnetic grasper was easy to use and provided adequate tissue retraction and exposure. Conclusions: The Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System is safe and feasible to use in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Routine use of this system may facilitate a reduction in the total number of laparoscopic trocars used, leading to less tissue trauma and improved cosmesis. Additional studies are needed to determine the applicability and utility of this system for other general surgery cases.},

	abstract = {Self-propelled microrobots have recently shown promising results in several scenarios at the microscale, such as targeted drug delivery and micromanipulation of cells. However, none of the steering systems available in the literature enable humans to intuitively and effectively control these microrobots in the remote environment, which is a desirable feature. In this paper we present an innovative teleoperation system with force reflection that enables a human operator to intuitively control the positioning of a self-propelled microjet. A particle-filter-based visual tracking algorithm tracks at runtime the position of the microjet in the remote environment. A 6-degrees-of-freedom haptic interface then provides the human operator with compelling haptic feedback about the interaction between the controlled microjet and the environment, as well as enabling the operator to intuitively control the target position of the microjet. Finally, a wireless magnetic control system regulates the orientation of the microjet to reach the target point. The viability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two experimentsz enrolling twenty-eight subjects. In both experiments providing haptic feedback significantly improved the performance and the perceived realism of the considered tasks.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a review of the major haptic feedback teleoperation systems for micromanipulation. During the last decade, the handling of micrometer-sized objects has become a critical issue. Fields of application from material science to electronics demonstrate an urgent need for intuitive and flexible manipulation systems able to deal with small-scale industrial projects and assembly tasks. Two main approaches have been considered: fully automated tasks and manual operation. The first one require fully pre determined tasks, while the later necessitates highly trained operators. To overcome these issues the use of haptic feedback teleoperation where the user manipulates the tool through a joystick whilst feeling a force feedback, appears to be a promising solution as it allows high intuitiveness and flexibility. Major advances have been achieved during this last decade, starting with systems that enable the operator to feel the substrate topology, to the current state-of-the-art where 3D haptic feedback is provided to aid manipulation tasks. This paper details the major achievements and the solutions that have been developed to propose 3D haptic feedback for tools that often lack 3D force measurements. The use of virtual reality to enhance the immersion is also addressed. The strategies developed provide haptic feedback teleoperation systems with a high degree of assistance and for a wide range of micromanipulation tools. Based on this expertise on haptic for micromanipulation and virtual reality assistance it is now possible to propose microassembly systems for objects as small as 1 to 10 micrometers. This is a mature field and will benefit small-scale industrial projects where precision and flexibility in microassembly are required. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article presents an overview of the current state of research and application of haptic (primarily kinesthetic) feedback and force-based teleoperation in the context of surgical robotics. Telerobotic surgery provides an approach for transferring the sensorimotor skills of a surgeon through a robotic platform to perform surgical intervention inside a patient’s body. Integration of advanced sensing and haptic technologies in telerobotic surgery can help to enhance the sensory awareness and motor accuracy of the surgeon, thereby leading to improved surgical procedures and outcomes for patients. The primary mode of sensory feedback has been through 3-D visual observation using stereo endoscopes. However, until recently, the sense of touch, i.e., haptics, has been missing in the commercial telesurgery robots approved for use in the operating room despite over two decades of research and development in the field of haptics for teleoperated systems (“telehaptics”). Research has shown that high-fidelity force feedback can enhance the performance of telesurgery and potential outcomes by enabling the surgeon to have a more natural feel of interaction between surgical tools and tissue as normally experienced during open surgery. Interaction forces, such as those generated during palpation of tissue, insertion of a needle, unintentional (and potentially unsafe) exertion of force by a tool, suture breakage, needle slippage, or tool interaction, are replaced by indirect (virtual) sensations, termed visual haptics, which provides an alternative to sensory compensation. Although there is a significant amount of literature supporting this benefit, there are still several important technical challenges in introducing haptics in telesurgery, including instrumentation, fidelity (transparency), stability, and modalities for force reflection, e.g., direct or indirect. This article examines these challenges and discusses recent work on haptics-based teleoperated surgical robotic systems.},

	abstract = {Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a procedure used to treat patients with large or irregularly shaped kidney stones. Surgical instruments are inserted through a small incision to access the kidney and remove the calculi. Surgeons who have less experience with the procedure manifest significantly higher rates of complications due to the procedure’s steep learning curve. This issue is further exacerbated by a lack of training opportunities in clinical settings. This paper introduces a teleoperative framework that can provide training to surgeons as well as assistance during procedures, based on two main components. Firstly, a type of constrained inverse kinematics that decouples the tooltip position from its orientation using a remote centre of motion, and incorporates the joint limits analytically. This reduces the workload of the procedure by having the surgeon control only the tooltip position rather than the position and the orientation while preventing the inverse kinematics from returning joint angles outside of the robot’s abilities. This kinematic framework also allows a three-degrees-of-freedom haptic device to control a six-degrees-of-freedom manipulator. Secondly, haptic feedback is provided to help guide and teach the surgeon during the procedure. Haptic feedback allows the surgeon to remain in full control during the procedure while still receiving haptic cues and assistance. Experimental results indicate that the haptic cues improved user’s accuracy, and they had shorter and smoother paths. This leads to a shorter procedure time overall. The results also indicate that the haptic assistance helped teach users the ideal trajectory of the procedure and that users who were taught with haptic feedback performed better than those who never experienced any haptic feedback.},

	abstract = {Shared autonomy teleoperation can guarantee safety, but does so by reducing the human operator’s control authority, which can lead to reduced levels of human-robot agreement and user satisfaction. This paper presents a novel haptic shared autonomy teleoperation paradigm that uses haptic feedback to inform the user about the inner state of a shared autonomy paradigm, while still guaranteeing safety. This differs from haptic shared control, which uses haptic feedback to inform the user’s actions, but gives the human operator full control over the robot’s actions. We conducted a user study in which twelve users flew a simulated UAV in a search-and-rescue task with no assistance or assistance provided by haptic shared control, shared autonomy, or haptic shared autonomy. All assistive teleoperation methods use control barrier functions to find a control command that is both safe and as close as possible to the human-generated control command. For assistive teleoperation conditions with haptic feedback, we apply a force to the user that is proportional to the difference between the human-generated control and the safe control. We find that haptic shared autonomy improves the user’s task performance and satisfaction. We also find that haptic feedback in assistive teleoperation can improve the user’s situational awareness. Finally, results show that adding haptic feedback to shared-autonomy teleoperation can improve human-robot agreement.},

	abstract = {Although robotic telemanipulation has always been a key technology for the nuclear industry, little advancement has been seen over the last decades. Despite complex remote handling requirements, simple mechanically linked master-slave manipulators still dominate the field. Nonetheless, there is a pressing need for more effective robotic solutions able to significantly speed up the decommissioning of legacy radioactive waste. This paper describes a novel haptic shared-control approach for assisting a human operator in the sort and segregation of different objects in a cluttered and unknown environment. A three-dimensional scan of the scene is used to generate a set of potential grasp candidates on the objects at hand. These grasp candidates are then used to generate guiding haptic cues, which assist the operator in approaching and grasping the objects. The haptic feedback is designed to be smooth and continuous as the user switches from a grasp candidate to the next one, or from one object to another one, avoiding any discontinuity or abrupt changes. To validate our approach, we carried out two human-subject studies, enrolling 15 participants. We registered an average improvement of 20.8\%, 20.1\%, and 32.5\% in terms of completion time, linear trajectory, and perceived effectiveness, respectively, between the proposed approach and standard teleoperation.},

	abstract = {During suturing tasks performed with minimally invasive surgical robots, configuration singularities and joint limits often force surgeons to interrupt the task and re-grasp the needle using dual-arm movements. This yields an increased operator's cognitive load, time-to-completion and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a haptic-guided shared control method for grasping the needle with the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM) of the da Vinci robot avoiding such issues. We suggest a cost function consisting of (i) the distance from robot joint limits and (ii) the task-oriented manipulability along the suturing trajectory. Evaluating the cost and its gradient on the needle grasping manifold allows us to obtain the optimal grasping pose for joint-limit and singularity free robot movements during suturing. We compute force cues and display them through the Master Tool Manipulator (MTM) to guide the surgeon towards the optimal grasp. As such, our system helps the operator to choose a grasping configuration that allows the robot to avoid joint limits and singularities during post-grasp suturing movements. We show the effectiveness of the proposed haptic-guided shared control method during suturing using both simulated and real experiments. The results illustrate that our approach significantly improves the performance in terms of needle re-grasping.},

Despite the complex dexterity requirements of cutting tasks, very simple mechanically-linked master-slave manipulators still dominate many of the above fields (e.g., nuclear robotics). Moreover, even when more dexterous manipulators are available (e.g., in robot-assisted surgery), the employed systems show little or no autonomy, delegating all control to the experience of the human operator. To ameliorate this situation, we present two haptic shared-control approaches for robotic cutting. They are designed to assist the human operator by enforcing different nonholonomic-like constraints representative of the cutting kinematics. To validate our approach, we carried out a human-subject experiment in a real cutting scenario. We compared our shared-control techniques with each other and with a standard haptic teleoperation scheme. Results show the usefulness of assisted control schemes in complex applications such as cutting. However, they also show a discrepancy between objective and subjective metrics.},

Design guidelines for human-automation interaction aim to avoid such issues and commonly agree that the human should have continuous interaction and communication with the automation system and its authority level and should retain final authority. This paper argues that haptic shared control is a promising approach to meet the commonly voiced design guidelines for human-automation interaction, especially for automotive applications. The goal of the paper is to provide evidence for this statement, by discussing several realizations of haptic shared control found in literature. We show that literature provides ample experimental evidence that haptic shared control can lead to short-term performance benefits (e.g., faster and more accurate vehicle control; lower levels of control effort; reduced demand for visual attention). We conclude that although the continuous intuitive physical interaction inherent in haptic shared control is expected to reduce long-term issues with human-automation interaction, little experimental evidence for this is provided. Therefore, future research on haptic shared control should focus more on issues related to long-term use such as trust, overreliance, dependency on the system, and retention of skills.},

	abstract = {During traditional surgery, the surgeons’ hands are in direct contact with organs, and surgeons rely on the sense of touch to perform surgery. In teleoperated robotic systems, all physical connections between the surgeon and both the robot and patient, are absent. The surgeon must estimate the force exerted on organs, based only on visual deformation of tissues he is pulling, pushing, gripping, or suturing. It is hard to imagine how to operate with no haptic sensations, and it is surprising that commercially available robots didn’t include until now any Haptic Feedback, despite reports about tissue injury, and inability to perform complex manipulation. The sense of touch must be created by stimuli sensed by the surgeon. Haptic sensors are required to collect and send haptic information, and display them on the operator’s side, creating telepresence, known as transparency. Multiple ways have been developed to improve transparency through force feedback and tactile feedback. However, this interferes with the stability of the closed-loop controlling interactions between master, robot and remote environment. Cutaneous feedback is more stable and less transparent; force feedback is more transparent and less stable. Thus, multimodal platforms of haptic feedback would try to find the best trade-off between both modalities.},

A number of dental procedures such as crown preparation and opening access to the pulp can be simulated with various shapes of dental drill. The system allows students to practise surgery in the correct postures as in the actual environment by combining 3D tooth and tool models upon the real-world view and displaying the result through a video see-through head mounted display (HMD). The system monitors the important features such as applied forces and tool movement that characterize the quality of the procedure. Automatic performance assessment is achieved by comparing outcome and process features of a student with the best matching expert.

In this study, we studied whether guidance from a robotic steering wheel can improve one's short-term learning of steering a simulated vehicle. We developed a computer algorithm that adapted the firmness of the guidance based on ongoing error. Training with "guidance-as-needed" or "fixed guidance" allowed participants to learn to steer without experiencing large errors and produced slightly better immediate retention than did training without guidance, apparently because participants were better able to learn when to initiate turns. Training with guidance-as-needed produced slightly better results than training with fixed guidance: the guidance-as-needed participants' errors were significantly smaller when guidance was removed. However, this difference quickly dissipated with more practice. We conclude that haptic guidance can benefit short-term learning of a steering-type task while also limiting performance errors during training.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00464-007-9683-0},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The lack of haptic feedback (HF) in robotic surgery is one of the major concerns of novice surgeons to that field. The superior visual appearances acquired during robotic surgery may give clues that make HF less important.
METHODS: We surveyed 52 individuals on their perception of HF during robotic surgery. The first group of 34 surgically inexperienced people used the da Vinci robot for their first time (drylab). The second group included 8 laparoscopic surgeons with experience up to a fifth robotic operation. The third group included 10 surgical experts with substantial experience (150-650 robotic cases). Visual analog assessment was made of perception of HF, how much HF was missed, how much the absence of HF impaired the operators' level of comfort. Robotic experts were asked if complications have occurred as a result of a lack of HF.
RESULTS: Of the first group, 50\% reported the perception of HF, as did 55\% of the second group and 100\% of the third group (difference between group 1 and group 3: p {\textless} 0.05). The first group missed HF for 6.5; the second group for 4.3, and the third group for 4 (difference between groups 1 and 3: p {\textless} 0.05). The surgical experts claimed to have missed HF for 7.2 s when they first started robotic surgery (Difference to now: p {\textless} 0.05). The lack of HF caused discomfort for the first group of 4; for the second group of 4,4, and for the third group of 2,6. One complication was reported by the robotic experts as resulting from the lack of HF.
CONCLUSIONS: The data support the conclusion that even beginners quickly experience the perception of HF when performing robotic surgery. With more experience, perception of HF and the level of comfort with robotic surgery increases significantly. This perception of HF makes "real" HF less important and demonstrates that its importance is overestimated by novices in robotic surgery.},

OctoMag was primarily designed to control intraocular microrobots for delicate retinal procedures, but it also has potential uses in other medical applications or micromanipulation under an optical microscope.},

	abstract = {Fine manipulation tasks, such as threading cable ties or slotting a battery, are notoriously difficult for robots because they require precision, careful coordination of contact forces, and closed-loop visual feedback. Performing these tasks typically requires high-end robots, accurate sensors, or careful calibration, which can be expensive and difficult to set up. Can learning enable low-cost and imprecise hardware to perform these fine manipulation tasks? We present a low-cost system that performs end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with a custom teleoperation interface. Imitation learning, however, presents its own challenges, particularly in high-precision domains: errors in the policy can compound over time, and human demonstrations can be non-stationary. To address these challenges, we develop a simple yet novel algorithm, Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT), which learns a generative model over action sequences. ACT allows the robot to learn 6 difficult tasks in the real world, such as opening a translucent condiment cup and slotting a battery with 80-90\% success, with only 10 minutes worth of demonstrations.

Recent motor learning studies have demonstrated that exaggeration of errors helps trainees learn to perform tasks with greater speed and accuracy. We hypothesized that training in a force field that pushes the operator away from a desired path would improve their performance on a virtual reality ring-on-wire task. Forty surgical novices trained under a no-force, guidance, or error-amplifying force field over five days. Completion time, translational and rotational path error, and combined error-time were evaluated under no force field on the final day. The groups significantly differed in combined error-time, with the guidance group performing the worst. Error-amplifying field participants showed the most improvement and did not plateau in their performance during training, suggesting that learning was still ongoing. Guidance field participants had the worst performance on the final day, confirming the guidance hypothesis. Participants with high initial path error benefited more from guidance. Participants with high initial combined error-time benefited more from guidance and error-amplifying force field training. Our results suggest that error-amplifying and error-reducing haptic training for robot-assisted telesurgery benefits trainees of different abilities differently.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, Robot-Assisted Surgeries (RAS), have become more prevalent in facilitating successful operations. Of the various types of RAS, the domain of collaborative surgery has gained traction in medical research. Prominent examples include providing haptic feedback to sense tissue consistency, and automating sub-tasks during surgery such as cutting or needle hand-off - pulling and reorienting the needle after insertion during suturing. By fragmenting suturing into automated and manual tasks the surgeon could essentially control the process with one hand and also circumvent workspace restrictions imposed by the control interface present at the surgeon's side during the operation. This paper presents an exploration of a discrete reinforcement learning-based approach to automate the needle hand-off task. Users were asked to perform a simple running suture using the da Vinci Research Kit. The user trajectory was learnt by generating a sparse reward function and deriving an optimal policy using Q-learning. Trajectories obtained from three learnt policies were compared to the user defined trajectory. The results showed a root-mean-square error of [0.0044mm, 0.0027mm, 0.0020mm] in ℝ3. Additional trajectories from varying initial positions were produced from a single policy to simulate repeated passes of the hand-off task.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Validated methods of objective assessments of surgical skills are resource intensive. We sought to test a web-based grading tool using crowdsourcing called Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical Skill.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional Review Board approval was granted to test the accuracy of Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk and Facebook crowdworkers compared with experienced surgical faculty grading a recorded dry-laboratory robotic surgical suturing performance using three performance domains from a validated assessment tool. Assessor free-text comments describing their rating rationale were used to explore a relationship between the language used by the crowd and grading accuracy.
RESULTS: Of a total possible global performance score of 3-15, 10 experienced surgeons graded the suturing video at a mean score of 12.11 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 11.11-13.11). Mechanical Turk and Facebook graders rated the video at mean scores of 12.21 (95\% CI, 11.98-12.43) and 12.06 (95\% CI, 11.57-12.55), respectively. It took 24 h to obtain responses from 501 Mechanical Turk subjects, whereas it took 24 d for 10 faculty surgeons to complete the 3-min survey. Facebook subjects (110) responded within 25 d. Language analysis indicated that crowdworkers who used negation words (i.e., "but," "although," and so forth) scored the performance more equivalently to experienced surgeons than crowdworkers who did not (P {\textless} 0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: For a robotic suturing performance, we have shown that surgery-naive crowdworkers can rapidly assess skill equivalent to experienced faculty surgeons using Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical Skill. It remains to be seen whether crowds can discriminate different levels of skill and can accurately assess human surgery performances.},

The expert-in-the-loop (EIL) framework incorporates a fuzzy interface system in order to provide a trainee with adaptive authority over the procedure as well as hand-over-hand haptic guidance adjusted in real time based on the proficiency level of the trainee. The EIL expertise-oriented framework enables performance of a surgical procedure by an expert surgeon on a patient, while simultaneously providing a trainee at any stage of the motor-skills development with multimodal training without jeopardizing patient safety. Closed-loop stability of the system is investigated using the circle criterion and it is shown that the proposed architecture is unconditionally stable. Experimental evaluations are presented in support of the proposed platform through the implementation of a dual-console surgical setup consisting of the classic da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the dV-Trainer master console (Mimic Technology, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA). To the best of our knowledge, the implemented setup is the first research platform for dual-console studies involving the classic da Vinci surgical system.},

However, investigations of new methods yielded inconclusive results regarding their effectiveness to enhance learning due to the diversity of tasks, haptic designs, participants’ skill level, and study protocols. In this review, we developed a taxonomy to identify generalizable ﬁndings out of publications on haptic training. In the taxonomy, we grouped the results of studies on healthy learners based on participants’ skill level and tasks’ characteristics. Our inspection of included studies revealed that: i) Performance-enhancing haptic methods were beneﬁcial for novices, ii) Training with haptics was as effective as training with other feedback modalities, and iii) Performance-enhancing and performance-degrading haptic methods were useful for the learning of temporal and spatial aspects, respectively. We also observed that these ﬁndings are in line with results from robotaided neurorehabilitation studies on patients. Our review suggests that haptic training can be effective to foster learning, especially when the information cannot be provided with other feedback modalities. We believe the ﬁndings from the taxonomy constitute a general guide, which can assist researchers when designing studies to investigate the effectiveness of haptics on learning different tasks.

	abstract = {In a previous study, we found that haptic guidance from a robotic steering wheel can improve short-term learning of steering of a simulated vehicle, in contrast to several studies of other tasks that had found that the guidance either impairs or does not aid motor learning. In this study, we examined whether haptic guidance-as-needed can improve long-term retention (across 1 week) of the steering task, with age and initial skill level as independent variables. Training with guidance-as-needed allowed all participants to learn to steer without experiencing large errors. For young participants (age 18–30), training with guidance-as-needed produced better long-term retention of driving skill than did training without guidance. For older participants (age 65–92), training with guidance-as-needed improved long-term retention in tracking error, but not significantly. However, for a subset of less skilled, older subjects, training with guidance-as-needed significantly improved long-term retention. The benefits of guidance-based training were most evident as an improved ability to straighten the vehicle direction when coming out of turns. In general, older participants not only systematically performed worse at the task than younger subjects (errors ∼3 times greater), but also apparently learned more slowly, forgetting a greater percentage of the learned task during the 1 week layoffs between the  experimental sessions. This study demonstrates that training with haptic guidance can benefit long-term retention of a driving skill for young and for some old drivers. Training with haptic guidance is more useful for people with less initial skill.},

Nevertheless, there exists no consensus regarding a standard curriculum of simulation-based training. This study introduces an automatic, adaptive curriculum where the training session is real-time scheduled on the basis of the trainee’s performances. Methods: An experimental study using the master console of the da Vinci Research Kit (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, US) was carried out to test this approach. Tasks involving fundamental skills of robotic surgery were designed and simulated in VR. Twelve participants without medical background along with twelve medical residents were randomly and equally divided into two groups: a control group, self-managing the training session, and an experimental group, undergoing the proposed adaptive training. Results: The performances of the experimental users were signiﬁcantly better with respect to the ones of the control group after training (non-medical: p {\textless} 0.01; medical: p = 0.02). This trend was analogous in the non-medical and medical populations and no signiﬁcant difference was identiﬁed between these two classes (even in the baseline assessment). Conclusion: The analysis of the learning of the involved surgical skills highlighted how the proposed adaptive training managed to better identify and compensate for the trainee’s gaps. The absence of initial difference between the non-medical and medical users underlines that robotic surgical devices require speciﬁc training before clinical practice. Signiﬁcance: This feasibility study could pave the way towards the improvement of simulation-based training curricula.},

This work proposes a robotic assistance-as-needed method for training with surgical teleoperated robots. The method adapts the intensity of the assistance according to the trainee's current and past performance while gradually increasing the level of control of the trainee as the training progresses. The work includes an experiment comprising 160 acquisition sessions from 16 novice subjects performing a bimanual teleoperated exercise with a da Vinci Research Kit surgical console. Results capture the subtleties in the task's learning curve with and without robotic assistance and hint at the potential of robotic assistance for complex visuomotor training. Although robotic assistance for motor learning has received mixed results that range from beneficial to detrimental effects, this study shows such assistance may increase the rate of learning of certain skills in complex motor tasks.},

	abstract = {Automation has the potential to improve the standard of care but is difficult to realize due to perceptual challenges, especially in soft-tissue surgery. Machine learning can provide solutions, but typically requires large amounts of training data, which is time-consuming to collect. Even with shared platforms, hardware differences can prevent effective sharing of data between institutions. This letter proposes a standardized simulation platform for training and testing algorithms to control surgical robotic systems, which is built upon an open-source simulator, the Asynchronous Multi-Body Framework (AMBF), to enable quick prototyping of different scenes. An illustrative example of a suturing task on a phantom is presented and has formed the basis of a challenge, released to the community. The top-level contribution is the open-source release of a dynamic simulation environment that enables realistic suturing on a phantom, but supporting contributions include its extendable architectural design and a series of algorithmic optimizations to achieve real-time control and collision detection, realistic behavior of the needle and suture, and generation of multi-modal ground-truth data, including labeled depth data. These capabilities enable simulation-based surgical training and support research in machine learning for surgical scene perception and autonomous action.},

	abstract = {In (re)learning of movements, haptic guidance can be used to direct the needed adaptations in motor control. Haptic guidance influences the main driving factors of motor adaptation, execution error, and control effort in different ways. Human-control effort is dissipated in the interactions that occur during haptic guidance. Minimizing the control effort would reduce the interaction forces and result in adaptation. However, guidance also decreases the magnitude of the execution errors, which could inhibit motor adaptation. The aim of this study was to assess how different types of haptic guidance affect kinematic adaptation in a novel visuomotor task. Five groups of subjects adapted to a reaching task in which the visual representation of the hand was rotated 30°. Each group was guided by a different force field. The force fields differed in magnitude and direction in order to discern the adaptation based on execution errors and control effort. The results demonstrated that the execution error did indeed play a key role in adaptation. The more the guiding forces restricted the occurrence of execution errors, the smaller the amount and rate of adaptation. However, the force field that enlarged the execution errors did not result in an increased rate of adaptation. The presence of a small amount of adaptation in the groups who did not experience execution errors during training suggested that adaptation could be driven on a much slower rate and on the basis of minimization of control effort as was evidenced by a gradual decrease of the interaction forces during training. Remarkably, also in the group in which the subjects were passive and completely guided, a small but significant adaptation occurred. The conclusion is that both minimization of execution errors and control effort drives kinematic adaptation in a novel visuomotor task, but the latter at a much slower rate.},

A vibrant surgical robotics research community is pivotal for conceptualizing such new systems as well as for developing and training the engineers and scientists to translate them into practice. The da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), an academic and industry collaborative effort to re-purpose decommissioned da Vinci surgical systems (Intuitive Surgical Inc, CA, USA) as a research platform for surgical robotics research, has been a key initiative for addressing a barrier to entry for new research groups in surgical robotics. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the publications that have been facilitated by the dVRK over the past decade.

This study addresses the hypothesis that VES is more stressful than open surgery using an ergonomic analysis of surgical tasks in a laboratory setting. Methods: A portable ergonomic work station was developed using a software Virtual Instrument (VI) interfaced with electronic hardware to compare the mental workload of 28 surgeons. The task was knot tying. The independent variable was work condition: rest, open technique, or VES technique. Dependent variables were tonic skin conductance level (SCL), electrooculogram (EOG), and subjective reports of concentration (CON) and stress (STR). Statistical analysis used nonparametric methods. Results: Subjects tied fewer knots using the VES technique (p {\textless}0.05). The SCL increased progressively from rest to the open task to the VES task (p {\textless}0.05), correlating with the subjects' reported increase in mental stress level (p {\textless}0.05). Eye blinks decreased from rest to the open task (p {\textless}0.05), consistent with the subjects' reported increase in level of mental concentration. From the open to the VES task, eye blinks increased (p {\textless}0.05), as would be expected given the greater demands of the VES task. Experienced subjects demonstrated less variability in SCL levels across tasks. Conclusions: VES technique requires greater concentration and places greater mental stress on surgeons than to open surgery. More experience with VES may decrease this effect. Studies are needed to improve the human-technology interface the stress.},

Variables which may impact on operation time include surgery case mix, hybrid technique, laparoscopic and open colorectal surgery experience, robotic surgical simulator training, technology, operating room team, and case complexity. Multidimensional analysis can address multiple indicators of surgical performance and include variables such as conversion rate, complications, oncological outcome and functional outcome. Analysis of patient outcome and/or global assessment of robotic skills may be the most reliable methods to assess the learning curve.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Electrosurgery is used in 80\% of surgical procedures. The technique allows surgeons to skilfully dissect tissues and achieve haemostasis. Since improper use of electrosurgery can lead to serious adverse events, training is required to potentially reduce the number and severity of these events. In this study we evaluate education and training in electrosurgery for surgical residents. Material and methods: Residents from six surgical subspecialties in the Netherlands were invited to anonymously complete a digital questionnaire about training, supervision and adverse events regarding electrosurgery. Results: Of the 197 respondents, 69\% had received some form of training; mostly a single theoretical lecture. The feeling of competence in theory and practical skills was positively rated by 39\% and 71\%, respectively. Moreover, 35\% judged the theoretical knowledge of their supervisors as insufficient and 65\% changed their electrosurgical application technique to the preference of the supervisor. 30\% of the residents had encountered a serious adverse event (e.g., burn wounds) related to the application of electrosurgery. Conclusions: The training of residents in theoretical aspects of electrosurgery is limited. Residents are not satisfied with the acquired theoretical knowledge of themselves and of their supervisors. Since adverse events related to electrosurgery occur frequently, more extensive education for both residents and their supervisors is needed to enhance patient safety.},

	abstract = {The benefits of electrosurgery have been acknowledged since the early 1920s, and nowadays more than 80\% of surgical procedures involve devices that apply energy to tissues. Despite its widespread use, it is currently unknown how the operator’s choices with regard to instrument selection and application technique are related to complications. As such, the manner in which electrosurgery is applied can have a serious influence on the outcome of the procedure and the well-being of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the variety of differences in usage of electrosurgical devices. Our approach is to measure these parameters to provide insight into application techniques. A sensor was developed that records the magnitude of electric current delivered to an electrosurgical device at a frequency of 10 Hz. The sensor is able to detect device activation times and a reliable estimate of the power-level settings. Data were recorded for 91 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed by different surgeons and residents. Results of the current measurement data show differences in the way electrosurgery is applied by surgeons and residents during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Variations are seen in the number of activations, the activation time, and the approach for removal of the gallbladder. Analysis showed that experienced surgeons have a longer activation time than residents (3.01 vs 1.41 seconds, P {\textless} .001) and a lower number of activations (102 vs 123). This method offers the opportunity to relate application techniques to clinical outcome and to provide input for the development of a best practice model.},

Conventional electrosurgery generator (ESG) targets tracking a preset power, manually set by surgeons per their experience before the surgery, with high accurate delivery. It is possible that this fixed power setting is not at the optimal point and, thus, increases the possibility of added-collateral biomedical tissue damage. To eliminate the potential negative impact of the fixed and ill-suited power setting, a real-time feedback control scheme is outlined in this article to adjust the preset power of the ESG to create an adaptive power reference, which is then tracked using an experimental high-frequency inverter (HFI) that enables electrosurgery with a fundamental (sinusoidal) output frequency of 390 kHz. Subsequently, experiments using the gallium nitride (GaN)-based HFI are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the new variable-power approach over the conventional fixed power approach in terms of collateral tissue damage reduction.},

	abstract = {Surgical resection is the current clinical standard of care for treating squamous cell carcinoma. Maintaining an adequate tumor resection margin is the key to a good surgical outcome, but tumor edge delineation errors are inevitable with manual surgery due to difficulty in visualization and hand-eye coordination. Surgical automation is a growing field of robotics to relieve surgeon burdens and to achieve a consistent and potentially better surgical outcome. This paper reports a novel robotic supervised autonomous electrosurgery technique for soft tissue resection achieving millimeter accuracy. The tumor resection procedure is decomposed to the subtask level for a more direct understanding and automation. A 4-DOF suction system is developed, and integrated with a 6-DOF electrocautery robot to perform resection experiments. A novel near-infrared fluorescent marker is manually dispensed on cadaver samples to define a pseudotumor, and intraoperatively tracked using a dual-camera system. The autonomous dual-robot resection cooperation workflow is proposed and evaluated in this study. The integrated system achieves autonomous localization of the pseudotumor by tracking the near-infrared marker, and performs supervised autonomous resection in cadaver porcine tongues (N =3). The three pseudotumors were successfully removed from porcine samples. The evaluated average surface and depth resection errors are 1.19 and 1.83mm, respectively. This work is an essential step towards autonomous tumor resections.},

	abstract = {Progress in automatic control of thermal processes and real-time estimation of heat penetration into live tissue has long been limited by the difficulty of obtaining high-fidelity thermodynamic models. Traditionally, in complex thermodynamic systems, it is often infeasible to estimate the thermophysical parameters of spatiotemporally varying processes, forcing the adoption of model-free control architectures. This comes at the cost of losing any robustness guarantees, and implies a need for extensive real-life testing. In recent years, however, infrared cameras and other thermographic equipment have become readily applicable to these processes, allowing for a real-time, non-invasive means of sensing the thermal state of a process. In this work, we present a novel physics-based approach to learning a thermal process's dynamics directly from such real-time thermographic data, while focusing attention on regions with high thermal activity. We call this process, which applies to any higher-dimensional scalar field, attention-based noise robust averaging (ANRA). Given a partial-differential equation model structure, we show that our approach is robust against noise, and can be used to initialize optimization routines to further refine parameter estimates. We demonstrate our method on several simulation examples, as well as by applying it to electrosurgical thermal response data on in vivo porcine skin tissue.},

	abstract = {Background: Electrosurgery is one of the most commonly used energy systems in laparoscopic surgery. Two major categories of potential complications related to electrosurgery in laparoscopy are mechanical trauma and electrothermal injury. The latter can result from unrecognized energy transfer in the operational field or, less commonly, to unnoticed stray current outside the laparoscopic field of view. Stray current can result from insulation failure, direct coupling, or capacitive coupling. Methods: We reviewed the literature concerning essential biophysics of electrosurgery, including electrosurgical waveform differentiation, tissue effect, and variables that determine tissue effect. The incidence of electrosurgical injuries and possible mechanisms responsible for the injuries are discussed. Different types of injuries may result in different clinical manifestations and histopathological findings. Gross and microscopic pathological check-ups of the injury sites may distinguish between different mechanisms, and thus provide further clues postoperatively. Results: Several recommended practices are proposed to avoid electrosurgical injury laparoscopically. To achieve electrosurgical safety and to prevent electrosurgical injuries, the surgical team should have a good understanding of the biophysics of electrosurgery, the basis of equipment and general tissue effects, as well as the surgeon’s spatial orientation and hand-eye coordination. Some intraoperative adjuvant procedures and newly developed safety devices have become available may aid to improve electrosurgical safety. Conclusions: Knowledge of the biophysics of electrosurgery and the mechanisms of electrosurgical injury is important in recognizing potential complications of electrosurgery in laparoscopy. Procedures for prevention, intraoperative adjuvant maneuvers, early recognition of the injury with in-time salvage treatment, and alertness to postoperative warning signs can help reduce such complications.},

	abstract = {Background: Bowel injury is a rare but serious complication of laparoscopic surgery. This review examines the incidence, location, time of diagnosis, causative instruments, management and mortality of laparoscopy-induced bowel injury.
Methods: The review was carried out using the MeSH browser within PubMed. The keywords used were ‘laparoscopy/adverse effects’ and ‘bowel perforation’. Additional articles were sourced from references within the studies found in the PubMed search.
Results: The incidence of laparoscopy-induced gastrointestinal injury was 0·13 per cent (430 of 329 935) and of bowel perforation 0·22 per cent (66 of 29 532). The small intestine was most frequently injured (55·8 per cent), followed by the large intestine (38·6 per cent). In at least 66·8 per cent of bowel injuries the diagnosis was made during the laparoscopy or within 24 h thereafter. A trocar or Veress needle caused the most bowel injuries (41·8 per cent), followed by a coagulator or laser (25·6 per cent). In 68·9 per cent of instances of bowel injury, adhesions or a previous laparotomy were noted. Management was mainly by laparotomy (78·6 per cent). The mortality rate associated with laparoscopy-induced bowel injury was 3·6 per cent.
Conclusion: At 0·13 per cent, the incidence of laparoscopy-induced bowel injury is small and such injury is usually discovered during the operation. Nevertheless, laparoscopy-induced bowel injury is associated with a high mortality rate of 3·6 per cent.},

	abstract = {Electrosurgery is a technique often used in dermatologic surgery to provide superficial or deep coagulation or cutting of the skin. The skin has poor conducting properties for the electrical flow of energy. Therefore, this energy builds up and is converted into heat. The endpoints of electrosurgery vary based on the waveform and result in either desiccation, coagulation, or sectioning of the skin. Harvard physicist William Bovie made one of the most important contributions to electrosurgery. His device offered both coagulation and cutting currents. This was used in the 1920s by a neurosurgeon to cut through tissues and control bleeding during surgical procedures.  The term “bovie” is still used to refer to an electrosurgery device or even the act of performing electrosurgery in general. The main types of electrical hemostasis used in dermatologic practice include electrocautery, electrofulguration, electrodesiccation, and biterminal electrocoagulation. Electrolysis and electrosection are other types of electrosurgery that may be utilized in the field of dermatology.},

	abstract = {Dynamic thermal management (DTM) mechanisms utilize embedded thermal sensors to collect fine-grained temperature information for monitoring the real-time thermal behavior of multi-core processors. However, embedded thermal sensors are very susceptible to a variety of sources of noise, including environmental uncertainty and process variation. This causes the discrepancies between actual temperatures and those observed by on-chip thermal sensors, which seriously affect the efficiency of DTM. In this paper, a smoothing filter-based Kalman prediction technique is proposed to accurately estimate the temperatures from noisy sensor readings. For the multi-sensor estimation scenario, the spatial correlations among different sensor locations are exploited. On this basis, a multi-sensor synergistic calibration algorithm (known as MSSCA) is proposed to improve the simultaneous prediction accuracy of multiple sensors. Moreover, an infrared imaging-based temperature measurement technique is also proposed to capture the thermal traces of an advanced micro devices (AMD) quad-core processor in real time. The acquired real temperature data are used to evaluate our prediction performance. Simulation shows that the proposed synergistic calibration scheme can reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 1.2 ∘C and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 15.8 dB (with a very small average runtime overhead) compared with assuming the thermal sensor readings to be ideal. Additionally, the average false alarm rate (FAR) of the corrected sensor temperature readings can be reduced by 28.6\%. These results clearly demonstrate that if our approach is used to perform temperature estimation, the response mechanisms of DTM can be triggered to adjust the voltages, frequencies, and cooling fan speeds at more appropriate times.},

	abstract = {Recent research is trying to leverage occupants' demand in the building's control loop to consider individuals' well-being and the buildings' energy savings. To that end, a real-time feedback system is needed to provide data about occupants' comfort conditions that can be used to control the building's heating, cooling, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The emergence of thermal imaging techniques provides an excellent opportunity for contactless data gathering with no interruption in occupant conditions and activities. There is increasing attention to infrared thermal camera usage in public buildings because of their non-invasive quality in reading the human skin temperature. However, the state-of-the-art methods need additional modifications to become more reliable. To capitalize potentials and address some existing limitations, new solutions are required to bring a more holistic view toward non-intrusive thermal scanning by leveraging the benefit of machine learning and image processing. This research implements an automated approach to collect and register simultaneous thermal and visual images and read the facial temperature in different regions. This paper also presents two additional investigations. First, through utilizing IButton wearable thermal sensors on the forehead area, we investigate the reliability of an in-expensive thermal camera (FLIR Lepton) in reading the skin temperature. Second, by studying the false-color version of thermal images, we look into the possibility of non-radiometric thermal images for predicting personalized thermal comfort. The results shows the strong performance of Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor prediction algorithms in predicting personalized thermal comfort. In addition, we have found that non-radiometric images can also indicate thermal comfort when the algorithm is trained with larger amounts of data.},

Our VerroTouch system measures the vibrations caused by tool contact and immediately recreates them on the master handles for the surgeon to feel. This augmentation enables the surgeon to feel the texture of rough surfaces, the start and end of contact with manipulated objects, and other important tactile events. While it does not provide low frequency forces, we believe vibrotactile feedback will be highly useful for surgical task execution, a hypothesis we we will test in future work.},

An example is medical thermography, which is being used more often in the detection of certain diseases and also in pain distribution. Current thermography processing software has some limitations mainly because it is developed for general applications and does not allow the identification of a Region Of Interest (ROI) with a specific anatomic shape. Current commercial software usually uses regular prismatic shapes for the definition of these regions, such as, rectangles, squares, circles and/or ellipse that poorly define complex geometric regions. These shapes present limitations when they do not fit with the complex geometric shape of the area that is to be characterized, either by the exclusion or the inclusion of irrelevant data in the evaluation of the thermal images. This particular limitation is observed no matter how accurate the definition of the ROI is. In order to improve characterization of thermal images, a computational application was developed. The limitations of existing software applications was overcome by designing an application that allows choosing any ROI, independently of its geometric shape and optimize it for further processing. This research work presents several segmentation algorithms and a comparison of untreated and optimized ROI's.},

This noninvasive technique provided a fast and reliable method to register partial or total arterial occlusion due to anastomotic failure, as well as due to external compression or kinking of the vessels. The dynamic infrared image sequences showed an improved rate and pattern of rewarming of the flap after an additional venous anastomosis was opened.

Infrared thermography measurements of the temperature of the plate, at the same surface where the heat flux is imposed, are used in the inverse analysis. The physical problem involves two-dimensional transient heat conduction in a plate with constant thermophysical properties, initially at a uniform temperature. A partial lumping across the plate's thickness is used for the mathematical formulation of the physical problem. We use the Steady State Kalman Filter (SSKF) for the solution of the inverse problem in real-time. The Steady State Kalman Filter results are compared to those obtained with the Classical Kalman Filter (CKF), in experiments where a laser diode at the 830 nm wavelength is used to heat the samples.},

The damage is represented by the 82 °C isotherm corresponding to the admissible tissue denaturation front position in relation to that of the cutting probe tip. The front location is assessed in real time through the infrared temperature readings of the 40 °C isotherm tightly related to the emerging denaturing patch size around the moving probe tip. A control-oriented denaturing hypermodel and its recasting into a form amenable for use in a moving-horizon locally linear model predictive control law are presented. The optimal control action is determined by solving a compound model predictive control problem that targets a number of active one-dimensional domains. This model is obtained from an offline trained nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input. To enforce the safety constraints, a supervisor system precedes the path planning control law. This system prevents excessive denaturation by excluding certain system moves, and determines system termination conditions. We experimentally demonstrate the system’s performance in two different line-cutting tasks on ex vivo porcine tissue with a desired denaturation front.},

Our experimental results on cadaver porcine tongue samples indicate that the proposed strategy reduces surface incision error and depth incision error by 40.03\% and 51.5\%, respectively, compared to a teleoperation strategy via da Vinci. Furthermore, compared to an autonomous path planning method with linear interpolation between the NIR markers, the proposed strategy reduces the incision depth error by 48.58\% by taking advantage of 3D tissue surface information.},

This study proposes a method for classifying thermal defects into material-related thermal bridges, geometrical thermal bridges, air leakages, and other thermal defects via thermal and visible images. To verify the performance of the proposed method, a field experiment was performed on a building in which thermal defects occurred. The results of the field experiment showed that the F-scores of the proposed method were 0.9707 for air leakage, 0.9000 for a material-related thermal bridge, 0.9775 for a geometrical thermal bridge, and 0.9228 for other defects.

Due to the great beneﬁts of combining the human intelligence with the higher power/precision abilities of robots, the shared control architecture occupies a wide spectrum among telerobotic systems. Although various shared control strategies have been proposed, a systematic overview to tease out the relation among different strategies is still absent. This survey, therefore, aims to provide a big picture for existing shared control strategies. To achieve this, we propose a categorization method and classify the shared control strategies into 3 categories: Semi-Autonomous control (SAC), State-Guidance Shared Control (SGSC), and State-Fusion Shared Control (SFSC), according to the different sharing ways between human operators and autonomous controllers. The typical scenarios in using each category are listed and the advantages/disadvantages and open issues of each category are discussed. Then, based on the overview of the existing strategies, new trends in shared control strategies, including the “autonomy from learning” and the “autonomy-levels adaptation,” are summarized and discussed.},

The aim is to understand the preferred sensory modality (or modalities) of students for learning. Teachers can use this knowledge to facilitate student learning. Moreover, students themselves can use this knowledge to change their learning habits. Five hundred undergraduate students belonging to two consecutive batches in their second year of undergraduate medical training were invited to participate in the exercise. Consenting students (415 students, 83\%) were administered a printed form of version 7.0 of the VARK questionnaire. Besides the questionnaire, we also collected demographic data, academic performance data (marks obtained in 10th and 12th grades and last university examination), and self-perceived learning style preferences. The majority of students in our study had multiple learning preferences (68.7\%). The predominant sensory modality of learning was aural (45.5\%) and kinesthetic (33.1\%). The learning style preference was not influenced by either sex or previous academic performance. Although we use a combination of teaching methods, there has not been an active effort to determine whether these adequately address the different types of learners. We hope these data will help us better our course contents and make learning a more fruitful experience.},

	abstract = {The provision of robotic assistance during motor training has proven to be effective in enhancing motor learning in some healthy trainee groups as well as patients. Personalizing such robotic assistance can help further improve motor (re)learning outcomes and cater better to the trainee's needs and desires. However, the development of personalized haptic assistance is hindered by the lack of understanding of the link between the trainee's personality and the effects of haptic guidance during human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we ran an experiment with 42 healthy participants who trained with a robotic device to control a virtual pendulum to hit incoming targets either with or without haptic guidance. We found that certain personal traits affected how users adapt and interact with the guidance during training. In particular, those participants with an 'Achiever gaming style' performed better and applied lower interaction forces to the robotic device than the average participant as the training progressed. Conversely, participants with the 'Free spirit game style' increased the interaction force in the course of training. We also found an interaction between some personal characteristics and haptic guidance. Specifically, participants with a higher 'Transformation of challenge' trait exhibited poorer performance during training while receiving haptic guidance compared to an average participant receiving haptic guidance. Furthermore, individuals with an external Locus of Control tended to increase their interaction force with the device, deviating from the pattern observed in an average participant under the same guidance. These findings suggest that individual characteristics may play a crucial role in the effectiveness of haptic guidance training strategies.},

In this article, we design a compact triaxial force sensor based on ﬁber Bragg gratings (FBGs). The force sensor is composed of an elastic structure, two supporting disks, and four ﬁbers. To achieve a good balance between the axial resolution and radial resolution, the elastic structure has parallel helical beams and the structure parameters of the sensor are optimized. The mechanical model of the sensor is proposed and the inﬂuence of temperature is also considered. The force sensor has the advantages of compact structure, easy assembly, and good scalability. An experimental setup is used to calibrate and evaluate the force sensor. The performance of the force sensor under dynamic force with different frequencies is also evaluated. The resolutions for the axial force and radial force are, respectively, 0.01 and 0.012 N with a range of 0–5 N. In addition, the sensor is ﬁxed on a robot arm to further evaluate its palpation ability. The experimental results show that the sensor can recognize different materials with different stiffnesses and the position of the rigid body in a silica model can also be determined.},

Despite these advancements, there has been no systematic and comprehensive evaluation of fusing RGB-D and thermal modalities to date. While autonomous driving using LiDAR, radar, RGB, and other sensors has garnered substantial research interest, along with the fusion of RGB and depth modalities, the integration of thermal cameras and, specifically, the fusion of RGB-D and thermal data, has received comparatively less attention. This might be partly due to the limited number of publicly available datasets for such applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of both, state-of-the-art and traditional methods used in fusing RGB-D and thermal camera data for various applications, such as site inspection, human tracking, fault detection, and others. The reviewed literature has been categorised into technical areas, such as 3D reconstruction, segmentation, object detection, available datasets, and other related topics. Following a brief introduction and an overview of the methodology, the study delves into calibration and registration techniques, then examines thermal visualisation and 3D reconstruction, before discussing the application of classic feature-based techniques as well as modern deep learning approaches. The paper concludes with a discourse on current limitations and potential future research directions. It is hoped that this survey will serve as a valuable reference for researchers looking to familiarise themselves with the latest advancements and contribute to the RGB-DT research field.},

In this paper we present a robust method for mobile and real-time 3D thermographic reconstruction through depth and thermal sensor fusion. A multimodal imaging device consisting of a thermal camera and a RGB-D sensor is calibrated geometrically and used for data capturing. Based on the underlying principle that temperature information remains robust against illumination and viewpoint changes, we present a Thermal-guided Iterative Closest Point (T-ICP) methodology to facilitate reliable 3D thermal scanning applications. The pose of sensing device is initially estimated using correspondences found through maximizing the thermal consistency between consecutive infrared images. The coarse pose estimate is further refined by finding the motion parameters that minimize a combined geometric and thermographic loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that complimentary information captured by multimodal sensors can be utilized to improve performance of 3D thermographic reconstruction. Through effective fusion of thermal and depth data, the proposed approach generates more accurate 3D thermal models using significantly less scanning data.},

Applications involving the segmentation and tracking of persons, vehicles, and other heat-emitting objects, for example, could beneﬁt tremendously from even coarsely accurate relative temperatures. With the increasing affordability of commercially available thermal cameras, as well as the imminent introduction of new, mobile form factors, such data will be readily and widely accessible. However, in order for thermal processing to complement existing methods in RGBD, there must be an effective procedure for calibrating RGBD and thermal cameras to create RGBDT (red, green, blue, depth, and thermal) data. In this paper, we present an automatic method for the synchronization and calibration of RGBD and thermal cameras in arbitrary environments. While traditional calibration methods fail in our multimodal setting, we leverage invariant features visible by both camera types. We ﬁrst synchronize the streams with a simple optimization procedure that aligns their motion statistic time series. We then ﬁnd the relative poses of the cameras by minimizing an objective that measures the alignment between edge maps from the two streams. In contrast to existing methods that use special calibration targets with key points visible to both cameras, our method requires nothing more than some edges visible to both cameras, such as those arising from humans. We evaluate our method and demonstrate that it consistently converges to the correct transform and that it results in high-quality RGBDT data.},

	abstract = {Wildlife monitoring is carried out for diverse reasons, and monitoring methods have gradually advanced through technological development. Direct field investigations have been replaced by remote monitoring methods, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become the most important tool for wildlife monitoring. Many previous studies on detecting wild animals have used RGB images acquired from UAVs, with most of the analyses depending on machine learning–deep learning (ML–DL) methods. These methods provide relatively accurate results, and when thermal sensors are used as a supplement, even more accurate detection results can be obtained through complementation with RGB images. However, because most previous analyses were based on ML–DL methods, a lot of time was required to generate training data and train detection models. This drawback makes ML–DL methods unsuitable for real-time detection in the field. To compensate for the disadvantages of the previous methods, this paper proposes a real-time animal detection method that generates a total of six applicable input images depending on the context and uses them for detection. The proposed method is based on the Sobel edge algorithm, which is simple but can detect edges quickly based on change values. The method can detect animals in a single image without training data. The fastest detection time per image was 0.033 s, and all frames of a thermal video could be analyzed. Furthermore, because of the synchronization of the properties of the thermal and RGB images, the performance of the method was above average in comparison with previous studies. With target images acquired at heights below 100 m, the maximum detection precision and detection recall of the most accurate input image were 0.804 and 0.699, respectively. However, the low resolution of the thermal sensor and its shooting height limitation were hindrances to wildlife detection. The aim of future research will be to develop a detection method that can improve these shortcomings.},

For that, we designed a new cross-calibration apparatus that produces consistent features which can be sensed by each of the cameras, therefore, acting as a multispectral "chessboard". The performance of the sensor is evaluated with two different cases of studies, where we show that the proposed system can detect "hidden" features of a 3D environment.},

In this method, a new loss function is designed with contrast fidelity (L2 norm) and sparse constraint (L1 norm), and the split Bregman method is used to optimize the loss function to obtain pre-fusion images. The final fused base layer is obtained by using a multi-level decomposition latent low-rank representation (MDLatLRR) method to decompose the pre-fusion images. Then, using the pre-fusion image as the reference, image structure similarity (SSIM) is introduced to evaluate the validity of detail information from the visible image, and the SSIM is then transformed into a weight map which is applied to the optimization method based on L2 norm to generate the final detail fusion layer. Our proposed method is evaluated and compared with 18 state-of-the-art image fusion methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively on four public datasets (i.e., CVC14 driving dataset, TNO dataset with natural scenarios, RoadScene dataset, and whole brain atlas dataset). The results show that our proposed method is generally better than the compared methods in terms of highlighting targets and retaining effective detail information.},

The vessel simulator was integrated with soft strain sensors to quantify and objectively assess manipulation skills and to provide real-time feedback to the trainee during a training session. Additionally, a portable and user-friendly training task board was produced to replicate anatomical constraints.

Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) is a technology that aims to take advantage of the variations in electrical properties of tissue to identify ectopic formations. It is difficult to develop BIS technologies without obtaining tumor tissue samples. One solution is to use a “tissue phantom,” a synthetic structure that mimics the properties of tissue. Current solutions using natural biomaterials, such as gelatin, have not been able to create complex tissue geometries that are vital to honing BIS diagnostics. However, semi-synthetic polymers, such has gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), offer the benefits of possessing similar electrical properties to their respective source biomaterial while being 3D printable. In this work, we first measured the impedance of porcine dermal tissue. We then applied these impedance measurements to create an electrically accurate tissue phantom using a photocurable hydrogel, GelMA, and varying concentrations of NaCl, aluminum powder, and titanium dioxide powder.},

A smart electrosurgical knife with integrated optical fibers has been designed previously to enable real-time use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for intraoperative margin assessment. In this paper, the thermal effect of the electrosurgical knife on tissue sensing is investigated. Methods: Porcine tissues and phantoms were used to investigate the performance of the smart electrosurgical knife after electrosurgery. The fat-to-water content ratio (F/W-ratio) served as the discriminative parameter for distinguishing tissues and tissue mimicking phantoms with varying fat content. The F/W-ratio of tissues and phantoms was measured with the smart electrosurgical knife before and after 14 minutes of electrosurgery. Additionally, a layered porcine tissue and phantom were sliced and measured from top to bottom with the smart electrosurgical knife. Results: Mapping the thermal activity of the electrosurgical knife's electrode during animal tissue electrosurgery revealed temperatures exceeding 400°C. Electrosurgery for 14 minutes had no impact on the device's accurate detection of the F/W-ratio. The smart electrosurgical knife enables real-time tissue detection and predicts the fat content of the next layer from 4 mm ahead. Conclusion: The design of the smart electrosurgical knife outlined in this paper demonstrates its potential utility for tissue detection during electrosurgery. Significance: In the future, the smart electrosurgical knife could be a valuable intraoperative margin assessment tool, aiding surgeons in detecting tumor borders and achieving negative margins.},

In this work, electrically conductive tissue-mimicking materials (TMMs) based on fat, water and agar/gelatin were produced with tunable optical properties. The composition of the phantoms allowed for the assessment of tumor margins using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, as the fat/water ratio served as a discriminating factor between the healthy and malignant tissue. Moreover, the possibility of using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or transglutaminase in combination with fat, water and gelatin for developing TMMs was studied. The diffuse spectral response of the developed phantom materials had a good match with the spectral response of porcine muscle and adipose tissue, as well as in vitro human breast tissue. Using the developed recipe, anatomically relevant heterogeneous breast phantoms representing the optical properties of different layers of the human breast were fabricated using 3D-printed molds. These TMMs can be used for further development of phantoms applicable for simulating the realistic breast conserving surgery workflow in order to evaluate the intraoperative optical-based tumor margin assessment techniques during electrosurgery.},

	abstract = {Active 3D thermography combines 3D shape and active thermography. Thus, it enables the provision of the intuitive thermographic inspection results for composite parts with a complex geometry. However, conventional 3D thermography acquires thermographic information and 3D shape through at least two independent sensors and requires complex cross-modal image registration algorithm based on the keypoint detection and matching. In this paper, an active 3D thermography system is proposed using only one thermal camera for moving objects. This system does not require an independent 3D sensor while the thermal camera acts as the 3D sensor. Nature behind that is that a mathematical model is proposed to unify the line scanning thermography and laser triangulation in the dynamic scanning process, taking a line laser as both heat excitation for active thermography and spatial coding for 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, the model enables the feature-free registration of thermogram sequence and 3D shape, so that the registration is fast and robust without keypoint features. The experiments on standard height specimens, 3D printing glass fiber composites, and carbon fiber intake tube have shown the error is calibrated within 0.25 mm in the range of 1 mm to 150 mm and evidenced the capability for sub-surface defects detection.},

	abstract = {The fusion of multi-modal sensors has become increasingly popular in autonomous driving and intelligent robots since it can provide richer information than any single sensor, enhance reliability in complex environments. Multisensor extrinsic calibration is one of the key factors of sensor fusion. However, such calibration is difﬁcult due to the variety of sensor modalities and the requirement of calibration targets and human labor. In this paper, we demonstrate a new targetless cross-modal calibration framework by focusing on the extrinsic transformations among stereo cameras, thermal cameras, and laser sensors. Speciﬁcally, the calibration between stereo and laser is conducted in 3D space by minimizing the registration error, while the thermal extrinsic to the other two sensors is estimated by optimizing the alignment of the edge features. Our method requires no dedicated targets and performs the multisensor calibration in a single shot without human interaction. Experimental results show that the calibration framework is accurate and applicable in general scenes.},

This study proposes a novel 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) camera motion correction method using only an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. A Kalman filter is adopted as a data fusion method to estimate the camera orientation and translation using IMU data. Six pinhole camera models are built to evaluate and correct 6-DOF camera motions. The motion correction efficiency and robustness are tested for different object distances and focal lengths of optical lenses. The motion correction ratio is statistically analysed and reaches approximately 80\%. The object distance has little effect on the motion correction ratio. The rotation-induced pixel movement is independent of the object distance. More than 90\% of the pixel movement noise is caused by camera rotation. The translation-induced pixel movement is inversely correlated with the object distance.},

Matlab software was used for image processing algorithm and training the data. In training the data, two methods were used which are training with normalization and without normalization. ANN input parameters were arc current, welding speed, number of pixel and location of weld bead. Double hidden layer was used where each one of them consists of 25 nodes, and the output parameter is new controlled welding speed. The testing data was performed using 100, 105 and 110 A with initial welding speed of 1.35, 1.40 and 1.45 mm/s. The measurement of weld bead was taken using two different methods, machine vision and manual measurement. The result showed that the width of weld bead on welding current of 105 A is close to the target of 7 mm with the average error of 0.49 mm. The best result for the machine vision and manual measurement can be achieved when the welding current is 110 A with a normalization.},

Its feedback control should be a fundamental requirement for automated welding. However, the real-time precise measurement of pool geometry is a difficult procedure. It has been shown that vision sensing is a promising approach for monitoring the weld pool geometry. Quality images that can be processed in real-time to detect the pool geometry are acquired by using a high shutter speed camera assisted with nitrogen laser as an illumination source. However, during practical welding, impurities or oxides existing on the pool surface complicate image processing. The image features are analyzed and utilized for effectively processing the image. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can always detect the pool boundary with sufficient accuracy in less than 100 ms. Based on this measuring technique, a robust adaptive system has been developed to control the pool area. Experiments show that the proposed control system can overcome the influence caused by various disturbances.},

	abstract = {Industrial robots have become more diverse and common for automating manufacturing processes, such as welding. Existing robotic control, however, is incapable of adaptively adjusting its operation in response to a dynamic welding environment, whereas a skilled human welder can. Sophisticated and adaptive robotic control relies on the effective and efficient processing of perception data, characterization and prediction of highly dynamic systems, and real-time adaptative robotic reactions. This research presents a preliminary study on developing appropriate Machine Learning (ML) techniques for real-time welding quality prediction and adaptive welding speed adjustment for GTAW welding at a constant current. In order to collect the data needed to train the hybrid ML models, two cameras are applied to monitor the welding process, with one camera (available in practical robotic welding) recording the top-side weld pool dynamics and a second camera (unavailable in practical robotic welding, but applicable for training purpose) recording the back-side bead formation. Given these two data sets, correlations can be discovered through a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is good at image characterization. With the CNN, top-side weld pool images can be analyzed to predict the back-side bead width during active welding control. Furthermore, the monitoring process has been applied to multiple experimental trials with varying speeds. This allowed the effect of welding speed on bead width to be modeled through a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Through the trained MLP, a computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm has been developed to adjust the travel speed accordingly to achieve an optimal bead width with full material penetration. Because of the nature of gradient descent, the robot would change faster when the quality is further away and then fine-tune the speed when it was close to the goal. Experimental studies have shown promising results on real-time bead width prediction and adaptive speed adjustment to realize ideal bead width.},

Recent investigations into haptic interfaces for millirobots have shown promise but lack the clinically motivated task scenarios necessary to justify future development. In this work, we investigate the utility of haptic feedback on bilateral teleoperation of a magnetically actuated millirobot in visually deficient conditions. We conducted an N = 23 user study in an aneurysm coiling inspired procedure, which required participants to navigate the robot through a maze in near total darkness to manipulate beads to a target under simulated fluoroscopy. We hypothesized that users will be better able to complete the telemanipulation task with haptic feedback while reducing excess forces on their surroundings compared to the no feedback conditions. Our results showed an over 40\% improvement in participants' bead scoring, a nearly 10\% reduction in mean force, and 13\% reduction in maximum force with haptic feedback, as well as significant improvements in other metrics. Results highlight that benefits of haptic feedback are retained when haptic feedback is removed. These findings suggest that haptic feedback has the potential to significantly improve millirobot telemanipulation and control in traditionally vision deficient tasks.},

In primitive adaptive MPC, constraints are not taken into account. However, after this adaptive MPC, tremendous progress has been made in MPC theory independently in a way that various constraints on the state and input variables are considered and closed loop stability is guaranteed. Ironically, it turns out that such a well developed MPC suffers from being employed as the control law in adaptive control scheme because it is difﬁcult to guarantee closed loop stability when the MPC is combined with adaptation algorithm and feasibility at all times owing to estimated parameters. This paper presents several important issues in the problem of adaptive MPC and introduces recent results and future work.},

These expressions are applicable when the substrate is relatively thin (as in most cases of welding and additive manufacturing of walls), or when the heat source penetrates deeply into the substrate (as in keyhole mode in laser or electron beam welding). The explicit expressions are based on the widely used Rosenthal 2-D solution, which yields results of the correct order of magnitude compared to experiments for a broad range of materials, processes, and parameters. Asymptotic analysis was applied and a new blending technique was developed to arrive to explicit expressions within 7\% of the exact solution. The key dimensionless group in this case is the Rosenthal number Ro, which enables the blending of solutions corresponding to fast and slow heat sources. A comprehensive survey of experimental results indicates a good agreement with the predictions resulting from the proposed expression.},

	abstract = {This graduate-level text focuses on the stability of adaptive systems, and offers a thorough understanding of the global stability properties essential to designing adaptive systems. Its self-contained, unified presentation of well-known results establishes the close connections between seemingly independent developments in the field. Prerequisites include a knowledge of linear algebra and differential equations, as well as a familiarity with basic concepts in linear systems theory.The first chapter sets the tone for the entire book, introducing basic concepts and tracing the evolution of the field from the 1960s through the 1980s. The first seven chapters are accessible to beginners, and the final four chapters are geared toward more advanced, research-oriented students. Problems ranging in complexity from relatively easy to quite difficult appear throughout the text.Topics include results in stability theory that emphasize incidents directly relevant to the study of adaptive systems; the stability properties of adaptive observers and controllers; the important concept of persistent excitation; the use of error models in systems analysis; areas of intense research activity; and five detailed case studies of systems in which adaptive control has proved successful},

	volume = {187},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
During thermal heating surgical procedures such as electrosurgery, thermal ablative treatment and hyperthermia, soft tissue deformation due to surgical tool-tissue interaction and patient movement can affect the distribution of thermal energy induced. Soft tissue temperature must be obtained from the deformed tissue for precise delivery of thermal energy. However, the classical Pennes bio-heat transfer model can handle only the static non-moving state of tissue. In addition, in order to enable a surgeon to visualise the simulated results immediately, the solution procedure must be suitable for real-time thermal applications.
Methods
This paper presents a formulation of bio-heat transfer under the effect of soft tissue deformation for fast or near real-time tissue temperature prediction, based on fast explicit dynamics finite element algorithm (FED-FEM) for transient heat transfer. The proposed thermal analysis under deformation is achieved by transformation of the unknown deformed tissue state to the known initial static state via a mapping function. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed formulation are evaluated on a realistic virtual human liver model with blood vessels to demonstrate a clinically relevant scenario of thermal ablation of hepatic cancer.
Results
For numerical accuracy, the proposed formulation can achieve a typical 10−3 level of normalised relative error at nodes and between 10−4 and 10−5 level of total errors for the simulation, by comparing solutions against the commercial finite element analysis package. For computation time, the proposed formulation under tissue deformation with anisotropic temperature-dependent properties consumes 2.518 × 10−4 ms for one element thermal loads computation, compared to 2.237 × 10−4 ms for the formulation without deformation which is 0.89 times of the former. Comparisons with three other formulations for isotropic and temperature-independent properties are also presented.
Conclusions
Compared to conventional methods focusing on numerical accuracy, convergence and stability, the proposed formulation focuses on computational performance for fast tissue thermal analysis. Compared to the classical Pennes model that handles only the static state of tissue, the proposed formulation can achieve fast thermal analysis on deformed states of tissue and can be applied in addition to tissue deformable models for non-linear heating analysis at even large deformation of soft tissue, leading to great translational potential in dynamic tissue temperature analysis and thermal dosimetry computation for computer-integrated medical education and personalised treatment.},

Robust and adaptive control strategies are required to achieve high performance in these dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive model predictive controller that combines model predictive control (MPC) with an underlying L1 adaptive controller to improve trajectory tracking of a system subject to unknown and changing disturbances. The L1 adaptive controller forces the system to behave in a predefined way, as specified by a reference model. A higher-level model predictive controller then uses this reference model to calculate the optimal reference input based on a cost function, while taking into account input and state constraints. We focus on the experimental validation of the proposed approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments on a quadrotor. We show that the proposed approach has a lower trajectory tracking error compared to non-predictive, adaptive approaches and a predictive, nonadaptive approach, even when external wind disturbances are applied.},

Fast adaptation to allow aggressive maneuvering and recovery from failures is also confronted. A second key feature in L1 adaptive control is the use of a state-prediction system, whose dynamics can be prescribed and provide the reference model to be followed when the tracking and estimation errors are small. The third feature is the tuning of parameter estimates using projection methods.

We propose a physics-guided material classification framework that relies on thermal properties of the object. Our key observation is that the rate of heating and cooling of an object depends on the unique intrinsic properties of the material, namely the emissivity and diffusivity. We leverage this observation by gently heating the objects in the scene with a low-power laser for a fixed duration and then turning it off, while a thermal camera captures measurements during the heating and cooling process. We then take this spatial and temporal “thermal spread function” (TSF) to solve an inverse heat equation using the finite-differences approach, resulting in a spatially varying estimate of diffusivity and emissivity. These tuples are then used to train a classifier that produces a fine-grained material label at each spatial pixel. Our approach is extremely simple requiring only a small light source (low power laser) and a thermal camera, and produces robust classification results with 86\% accuracy over 16 classes1.},

	abstract = {For several years, research work has been carried out at the University of Canterbury aimed at the development of a rapid prototyping and manufacturing process referred to as Robotic Foam Sculpting (RFS). This system uses a six-axis industrial robot and electrically-heated hot-wire and hot-blade tools to sculpt desired parts from blocks of polystyrene foam. The vision for this system is that it will be able to rapidly create large volume foam models at low cost, for a range of potential applications. Parts produced by the RFS system can potentially be used as investment casting patterns, cores for sculptures and architectural details, demonstration and testing models, wind tunnel test models, and many other potential applications. At the beginning of the work reported in this thesis, there was very little understanding of the nature of the surfaces produced by hot-tool cutting of foam, very little knowledge of the range of input cutting conditions that affected the surface quality, and almost no understanding of the relationships between the cutting strategy and the nature of the surfaces being produced. In addition, there was little evidence of published work on these subjects that was sufficiently robust to be applicable to the RFS system. This research was concerned with rectifying this gap in the existing knowledge. There were a number of different focal areas for this research. These included the surface texture of surfaces cut with hot tools, the effects of cutting strategy on the surface quality in single-pass cutting of foam, the effects of cutting strategy on the surface quality in multi-pass cutting, and the application of a current-control system to control the surface quality in real time during a cut. In each of the focal areas the goal was to develop a detailed understanding of the nature of the different aspects of surface quality, to map the factor interactions and dependencies that controlled these aspects of surface quality, to develop methods for predicting the expected surface quality based on cutting strategy (and vice versa) and to develop techniques for minimising the surface errors. The detailed investigation of the surface texture of surfaces produced with hot-tool cutting is presented in Chapter 4. This chapter explores the characteristic nature of foam surfaces, presents the development of a method of measuring the surface texture of foam, and investigates the usefulness of a range of standard texture parameters for assessing foam surface quality. It is concluded in this chapter that common texture parameters based on the relative heights of surface features are not capable of reliably discriminating between different foam surfaces, so a new texture parameter (the 10\%-Height Contiguous Diameter) is developed and implemented. Using this parameter, it is possible to reliably predict the surface texture to be expected for a given set of cutting conditions. Investigations of the cutting strategy in single-pass cutting are presented in Chapter 5. This chapter identifies the two key aspects of surface quality in single-pass cutting, the kerfwidth and the surface barrelling. Experimental work is carried out to investigate the relationships between these errors and the cutting strategy, and the factors that influence each of them are identified. In addition, statistical models are developed for the kerf along the length of a cut so that the kerf can be predicted based on cutting conditions. This chapter also includes a study of the cutting force in single-pass cutting, and develops models that allow the prediction of the expected cutting force for a given cutting strategy. A detailed study of the cutting strategy for multi-pass cutting is presented in Chapter 6. This study identifies the most significant surface errors in multi-pass cutting and determines the causes of each of these errors and the factor interactions and dependencies that have to be considered when developing a multi-pass cutting strategy. Once again, statistical models that allow the prediction of these surface errors based on cutting strategy, or the evaluation of cutting strategy parameters to achieve a desired surface quality, are developed. The models for cutting force in single-pass cutting are applied to multi-pass cutting, and it is found that these models can accurately predict the force in multi-pass cutting as well. The characterisation of the acoustic output in hot-tool cutting forms the subject matter of Chapter 7. This study establishes that the magnitude of the acoustic output is proportional to the cutting force experienced during the cut, and is therefore potentially suitable for use as a trigger signal for feedback current control. This would allow an acoustic signal to be used instead of the current force signal, which has a number of drawbacks that will be discussed in Chapter 2, the Background Material chapter. The specific trigger signal identified as being of most use is the acoustic output in the 4 – 12 kHz band, where the presence of any non-zero acoustic output above background noise is a reliable and repeatable indicator of the presence of thermomechanical cutting. The work presented in this thesis provides a detailed, quantitative, evidence-based and reliable understanding of the nature of the cutting strategy in hot-tool cutting of foam. The key cutting strategy parameters and the important aspects of surface quality for different cutting types are identified, the relationships between all these parameters are mapped, and quantitative models are developed that allow the output metrics like the surface quality or the cutting force to be predicted with a high degree of accuracy based on the input cutting strategy conditions. Armed with this understanding, it is possible to determine the most suitable cutting strategy for sculpting a given part, and to assess whether a given part can be sculpted with the RFS system. As such, the research problem posed at the start of this thesis has been largely solved, and the stage is set for further research to optimise the cutting strategy for sculpting different parts and to correct the remaining drawbacks of the RFS system to complete the development of a commercially-useful manufacturing system.},

The governing heat conduction equation is first transformed into a one-dimensional isotherm migration equation in spherical coordinates, which expresses the isotherm velocities as a function of the isotherm positions and their temperature derivatives. A finite difference formulation of this equation is then derived together with the corresponding boundary conditions. It is shown through a number of simulations that this system converges to the analytical solution when the temperature mesh is refined. The additional presence of a phase change results in a Stefan problem that can be solved approximately with some minor modifications to the method. The resulting system of equations can be used as a simple but accurate thermal model for some laser-material interaction processes such as laser heat treatments and laser cladding.},

	abstract = {Electrosurgical radio-frequency heating of tissue is widely applied in minimally invasive surgical procedures to dissect tissue with simultaneous coagulation to obtain hemostasis. The tissue effect depends on the cumulative heating that occurs in the vicinity of the moving blade electrode. In this work, a continuum thermomechanical model based on mixture theory, which accounts for the multiphase nature of soft hydrated tissues and includes transport and evaporation losses, is used to capture the transient heating effect of a moving electrode. The model takes into account the dependence of electrical conductivity and the evaporation rate on the water content in the tissue, as it changes in response to heating. Temperature prediction is validated with mean experimental temperature measured during in situ experiments performed on porcine liver tissue at different power settings of the electrosurgical unit. The model is shown to closely capture the temperature variation in the tissue for three distinct scenarios; with no visible cutting or coagulation damage at a low 10 W power setting, with coagulation damage but no tissue cutting at an intermediate power setting of 25 W, and with both coagulation and tissue cutting at a higher power setting of 50 W. Furthermore, an Arrhenius model is shown to capture tissue damage observed in the experiments. Increase in applied power was found to correlate with tissue cutting and concentrated damage near the electrode, but had little effect on the observed coagulation damage width. The proposed model provides, for the first time, an accurate tool for predicting temperature rise and evolving damage resulting from a moving electrode in pure-cut electrosurgery.},

Many other thermal damage processes have been described using the Arrhenius kinetic rate of formation approach, which has the advantage that it is inherently quantitative in nature and can easily be compared with quantitative markers of injury or histologic section. The vast majority of Arrhenius studies have been directed toward measurable cellular effects at relatively low temperatures.

	abstract = {The thermal damage of a three-dimensional bio-tissue model irradiated by a movable laser beam was studied in this work. By employing the DPL biological heat conduction model and Henriques’ thermal damage assessment model, the distribution of burn damage of vivo human tissue during laser therapy was analytically obtained. The influences of laser moving velocity, laser spot size, phase lags of heat flux and temperature gradient were discussed. It was found that the laser moving speed and the laser spot size greatly influence the thermal damage degree by affecting the energy concentration degree. The increases of the laser moving speed and laser spot size can enlarge the irradiated region and reduce the burn degree. A greater phase lag of temperature gradient led to lower accumulation of thermal energy and lower burn degree. However, the increment of heat flux phase lag leads to the thermal energy accumulation and more serious burn degree in the irradiated region.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a closed-form analytical solution of hyperbolic Pennes bioheat equation is obtained for spatial evolution of temperature distributions during moving laser thermotherapy of the skin and kidney tissues. The three-dimensional cubic homogeneous perfused biological tissue is adopted as a media and the Gaussian distributed function in surface and exponentially distributed in depth is used for modeling of laser moving heat source. The solution procedure is Eigen value method which leads to a closed form solution. The effect of moving velocity, perfusion rate, laser intensity, absorption and scattering coefficients, and thermal relaxation time on temperature profiles and tissue thermal damage are investigated. Results are illustrated that the moving velocity and the perfusion rate of the tissues are the main important parameters in produced temperatures under moving heat source. The higher perfusion rate of kidney compared with skin may lead to lower induced temperature amplitude in moving path of laser due to the convective role of the perfusion term. Furthermore, the analytical solution can be a powerful tool for analysis and optimization of practical treatment in the clinical setting and laser procedure therapeutic applications and can be used for verification of other numerical heating models.},

	abstract = {In this article, the major idea and mathematical aspects of model-based planning and real-time predictive control for laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) are presented. In particular, a computational framework and its major components developed by authors in recent years are reviewed. The framework provides the backbone for not only treatment planning but also real-time surgical monitoring and control with a focus on MR thermometry enabled predictive control and applications to image-guided LITT, or MRgLITT. Although this computational framework is designed for LITT in treating prostate cancer, it is further applicable to other thermal therapies in focal lesions induced by radio-frequency (RF), microwave and high-intensity-focused ultrasound (HIFU). Moreover, the model-based dynamic closed-loop predictive control algorithms in the framework, facilitated by the coupling of mathematical modelling and computer simulation with real-time imaging feedback, has great potential to enable a novel methodology in thermal medicine. Such technology could dramatically increase treatment efficacy and reduce morbidity.},
