	abstract = {Current commercially available robotic minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) platforms provide no haptic feedback of tool interactions with the surgical environment. As a consequence, novice robotic surgeons must rely exclusively on visual feedback to sense their physical interactions with the surgical environment. This technical limitation can make it challenging and time-consuming to train novice surgeons to proficiency in RMIS. Extensive prior research has demonstrated that incorporating haptic feedback is effective at improving surgical training task performance. However, few studies have investigated the utility of providing feedback of multiple modalities of haptic feedback simultaneously (multi-modality haptic feedback) in this context, and these studies have presented mixed results regarding its efficacy. Furthermore, the inability to generalize and compare these mixed results has limited our ability to understand why they can vary significantly between studies. Therefore, we have developed a generalized, modular multi-modality haptic feedback and data acquisition framework leveraging the real-time data acquisition and streaming capabilities of the Robot Operating System (ROS). In our preliminary study using this system, participants complete a peg transfer task using a da Vinci robot while receiving haptic feedback of applied forces, contact accelerations, or both via custom wrist-worn haptic devices. Results highlight the capability of our system in running systematic comparisons between various single and dual-modality haptic feedback approaches.},

	abstract = {The Hapkit is an open-source kinesthetic device used by educators to teach fundamentals of haptic interaction. Despite its pedagogical benefits, it cannot showcase ungrounded interactions. Here, we introduce an ungrounded Hapkit variant that generates moments at the wrist as the user interacts with a virtual environment. The device utilizes existing Hapkit hardware with 3D printed modifications to enable ungrounded kinesthetic feedback. We developed Arduino and Processing code that simulates ungrounded impacts, such as hitting a tennis ball, to demonstrate functionality. This device can serve as a valuable pedagogical tool in conjunction with the well-established Hapkit.},

	abstract = {The evolution of magnetically actuated millirobots gives rise to unique teleoperation challenges due to their non-traditional kinematic and dynamic architectures, as well as their frequent use of suboptimal imaging modalities. Recent investigations into haptic interfaces for millirobots have shown promise but lack the clinically motivated task scenarios necessary to justify future development. In this work, we investigate the utility of haptic feedback on bilateral teleoperation of a magnetically actuated millirobot in visually deficient conditions. We conducted an N = 23 user study in an aneurysm coiling inspired procedure, which required participants to navigate the robot through a maze in near total darkness to manipulate beads to a target under simulated fluoroscopy. We hypothesized that users will be better able to complete the telemanipulation task with haptic feedback while reducing excess forces on their surroundings compared to the no feedback conditions. Our results showed an over 40\% improvement in participants' bead scoring, a nearly 10\% reduction in mean force, and 13\% reduction in maximum force with haptic feedback, as well as significant improvements in other metrics. Results highlight that benefits of haptic feedback are retained when haptic feedback is removed. These findings suggest that haptic feedback has the potential to significantly improve millirobot telemanipulation and control in traditionally vision deficient tasks.},
