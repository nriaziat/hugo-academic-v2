abstract: In this paper, the robustness limitations of current recursive identification
  algorithms are highlighted. Then, it is shown how a particular non-recursive identification
  algorithm may improve the robustness to bounded disturbances and slowly time-varying
  parameters, at the expense of performing an on-line eigenvalue decomposition on
  a symmetric semidefinite positive matrix. Furthermore, contrary to “robustified”
  recursive identification algorithms, this algorithm does not require any a priori
  knowledge of a bound on the disturbances and of a bound on the unknown parameter
  values.
