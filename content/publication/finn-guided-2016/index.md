abstract: 'Reinforcement learning can acquire complex behaviors from high-level specifications.
  However, defining a cost function that can be optimized effectively and encodes
  the correct task is challenging in practice. We explore how inverse optimal control
  (IOC) can be used to learn behaviors from demonstrations, with applications to torque
  control of high-dimensional robotic systems. Our method addresses two key challenges
  in inverse optimal control: first, the need for informative features and effective
  regularization to impose structure on the cost, and second, the difficulty of learning
  the cost function under unknown dynamics for high-dimensional continuous systems.
  To address the former challenge, we present an algorithm capable of learning arbitrary
  nonlinear cost functions, such as neural networks, without meticulous feature engineering.
  To address the latter challenge, we formulate an efficient sample-based approximation
  for MaxEnt IOC. We evaluate our method on a series of simulated tasks and real-world
  robotic manipulation problems, demonstrating substantial improvement over prior
  methods both in terms of task complexity and sample efficiency.'
