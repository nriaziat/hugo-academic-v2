abstract: 'Fine manipulation tasks, such as threading cable ties or slotting a battery,
  are notoriously difficult for robots because they require precision, careful coordination
  of contact forces, and closed-loop visual feedback. Performing these tasks typically
  requires high-end robots, accurate sensors, or careful calibration, which can be
  expensive and difficult to set up. Can learning enable low-cost and imprecise hardware
  to perform these fine manipulation tasks? We present a low-cost system that performs
  end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with
  a custom teleoperation interface. Imitation learning, however, presents its own
  challenges, particularly in high-precision domains: errors in the policy can compound
  over time, and human demonstrations can be non-stationary. To address these challenges,
  we develop a simple yet novel algorithm, Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT),
  which learns a generative model over action sequences. ACT allows the robot to learn
  6 difficult tasks in the real world, such as opening a translucent condiment cup
  and slotting a battery with 80-90% success, with only 10 minutes worth of demonstrations.
