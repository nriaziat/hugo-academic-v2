abstract: Novel expressions in explicit form are presented for the estimation of the
  width of the bead, location of heat affected zone, and the width of any chosen isotherm
  in materials processes such as welding, additive manufacturing, laser heat treatment,
  and cutting. These expressions are applicable when the substrate is relatively thin
  (as in most cases of welding and additive manufacturing of walls), or when the heat
  source penetrates deeply into the substrate (as in keyhole mode in laser or electron
  beam welding). The explicit expressions are based on the widely used Rosenthal 2-D
  solution, which yields results of the correct order of magnitude compared to experiments
  for a broad range of materials, processes, and parameters. Asymptotic analysis was
  applied and a new blending technique was developed to arrive to explicit expressions
  within 7% of the exact solution. The key dimensionless group in this case is the
  Rosenthal number Ro, which enables the blending of solutions corresponding to fast
  and slow heat sources. A comprehensive survey of experimental results indicates
  a good agreement with the predictions resulting from the proposed expression.
