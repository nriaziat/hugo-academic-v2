abstract: In (re)learning of movements, haptic guidance can be used to direct the
  needed adaptations in motor control. Haptic guidance influences the main driving
  factors of motor adaptation, execution error, and control effort in different ways.
  Human-control effort is dissipated in the interactions that occur during haptic
  guidance. Minimizing the control effort would reduce the interaction forces and
  result in adaptation. However, guidance also decreases the magnitude of the execution
  errors, which could inhibit motor adaptation. The aim of this study was to assess
  how different types of haptic guidance affect kinematic adaptation in a novel visuomotor
  task. Five groups of subjects adapted to a reaching task in which the visual representation
  of the hand was rotated 30Â°. Each group was guided by a different force field. The
  force fields differed in magnitude and direction in order to discern the adaptation
  based on execution errors and control effort. The results demonstrated that the
  execution error did indeed play a key role in adaptation. The more the guiding forces
  restricted the occurrence of execution errors, the smaller the amount and rate of
  adaptation. However, the force field that enlarged the execution errors did not
  result in an increased rate of adaptation. The presence of a small amount of adaptation
  in the groups who did not experience execution errors during training suggested
  that adaptation could be driven on a much slower rate and on the basis of minimization
  of control effort as was evidenced by a gradual decrease of the interaction forces
  during training. Remarkably, also in the group in which the subjects were passive
  and completely guided, a small but significant adaptation occurred. The conclusion
  is that both minimization of execution errors and control effort drives kinematic
  adaptation in a novel visuomotor task, but the latter at a much slower rate.
