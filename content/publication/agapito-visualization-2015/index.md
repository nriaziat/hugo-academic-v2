abstract: In this paper, we present a system for visualizing temperature changes in
  a scene using an RGB-D camera coupled with a thermal camera. This system has applications
  in the context of maintenance of power equipments. We propose a two-stage approach
  made of with an oﬄine and an online phases. During the ﬁrst stage, after the calibration,
  we generate a 3D reconstruction of the scene with the color and the thermal data.
  We then apply the Viewpoint Generative Learning (VGL) method on the colored 3D model
  for creating a database of descriptors obtained from features robust to strong viewpoint
  changes. During the second online phase we compare the descriptors extracted from
  the current view against the ones in the database for estimating the pose of the
  camera. In this situation, we can display the current thermal data and compare it
  with the data saved during the oﬄine phase.
