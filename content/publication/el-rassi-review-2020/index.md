abstract: During traditional surgery, the surgeons’ hands are in direct contact with
  organs, and surgeons rely on the sense of touch to perform surgery. In teleoperated
  robotic systems, all physical connections between the surgeon and both the robot
  and patient, are absent. The surgeon must estimate the force exerted on organs,
  based only on visual deformation of tissues he is pulling, pushing, gripping, or
  suturing. It is hard to imagine how to operate with no haptic sensations, and it
  is surprising that commercially available robots didn’t include until now any Haptic
  Feedback, despite reports about tissue injury, and inability to perform complex
  manipulation. The sense of touch must be created by stimuli sensed by the surgeon.
  Haptic sensors are required to collect and send haptic information, and display
  them on the operator’s side, creating telepresence, known as transparency. Multiple
  ways have been developed to improve transparency through force feedback and tactile
  feedback. However, this interferes with the stability of the closed-loop controlling
  interactions between master, robot and remote environment. Cutaneous feedback is
  more stable and less transparent; force feedback is more transparent and less stable.
  Thus, multimodal platforms of haptic feedback would try to find the best trade-off
  between both modalities.
