 abstract = {During traditional surgery, the surgeons’ hands are in direct contact with organs, and surgeons rely on the sense of touch to perform surgery. In teleoperated robotic systems, all physical connections between the surgeon and both the robot and patient, are absent. The surgeon must estimate the force exerted on organs, based only on visual deformation of tissues he is pulling, pushing, gripping, or suturing. It is hard to imagine how to operate with no haptic sensations, and it is surprising that commercially available robots didn’t include until now any Haptic Feedback, despite reports about tissue injury, and inability to perform complex manipulation. The sense of touch must be created by stimuli sensed by the surgeon. Haptic sensors are required to collect and send haptic information, and display them on the operator’s side, creating telepresence, known as transparency. Multiple ways have been developed to improve transparency through force feedback and tactile feedback. However, this interferes with the stability of the closed-loop controlling interactions between master, robot and remote environment. Cutaneous feedback is more stable and less transparent; force feedback is more transparent and less stable. Thus, multimodal platforms of haptic feedback would try to find the best trade-off between both modalities.},
