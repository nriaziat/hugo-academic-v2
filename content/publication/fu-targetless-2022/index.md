abstract: The fusion of multi-modal sensors has become increasingly popular in autonomous
  driving and intelligent robots since it can provide richer information than any
  single sensor, enhance reliability in complex environments. Multisensor extrinsic
  calibration is one of the key factors of sensor fusion. However, such calibration
  is difﬁcult due to the variety of sensor modalities and the requirement of calibration
  targets and human labor. In this paper, we demonstrate a new targetless cross-modal
  calibration framework by focusing on the extrinsic transformations among stereo
  cameras, thermal cameras, and laser sensors. Speciﬁcally, the calibration between
  stereo and laser is conducted in 3D space by minimizing the registration error,
  while the thermal extrinsic to the other two sensors is estimated by optimizing
  the alignment of the edge features. Our method requires no dedicated targets and
  performs the multisensor calibration in a single shot without human interaction.
  Experimental results show that the calibration framework is accurate and applicable
  in general scenes.
