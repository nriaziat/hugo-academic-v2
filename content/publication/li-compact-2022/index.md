abstract: Force sensing is important for surgical robotics in order to realize surgical
  palpation and ensure surgical safety. In this article, we design a compact triaxial
  force sensor based on ﬁber Bragg gratings (FBGs). The force sensor is composed of
  an elastic structure, two supporting disks, and four ﬁbers. To achieve a good balance
  between the axial resolution and radial resolution, the elastic structure has parallel
  helical beams and the structure parameters of the sensor are optimized. The mechanical
  model of the sensor is proposed and the inﬂuence of temperature is also considered.
  The force sensor has the advantages of compact structure, easy assembly, and good
  scalability. An experimental setup is used to calibrate and evaluate the force sensor.
  The performance of the force sensor under dynamic force with different frequencies
  is also evaluated. The resolutions for the axial force and radial force are, respectively,
  0.01 and 0.012 N with a range of 0–5 N. In addition, the sensor is ﬁxed on a robot
  arm to further evaluate its palpation ability. The experimental results show that
  the sensor can recognize different materials with different stiffnesses and the
  position of the rigid body in a silica model can also be determined.
