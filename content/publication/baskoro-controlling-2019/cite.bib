 abstract = {In this study, the development of artificial neural network systems was proposed to keep the width of weld bead constant by controlling the welding speed. During Gas Tungsten Arc Welding, the weld bead was observed directly using machine vision system that utilized CCD camera. Matlab software was used for image processing algorithm and training the data. In training the data, two methods were used which are training with normalization and without normalization. ANN input parameters were arc current, welding speed, number of pixel and location of weld bead. Double hidden layer was used where each one of them consists of 25 nodes, and the output parameter is new controlled welding speed. The testing data was performed using 100, 105 and 110 A with initial welding speed of 1.35, 1.40 and 1.45 mm/s. The measurement of weld bead was taken using two different methods, machine vision and manual measurement. The result showed that the width of weld bead on welding current of 105 A is close to the target of 7 mm with the average error of 0.49 mm. The best result for the machine vision and manual measurement can be achieved when the welding current is 110 A with a normalization.},
