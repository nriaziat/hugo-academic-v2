abstract: Progress in automatic control of thermal processes and real-time estimation
  of heat penetration into live tissue has long been limited by the difficulty of
  obtaining high-fidelity thermodynamic models. Traditionally, in complex thermodynamic
  systems, it is often infeasible to estimate the thermophysical parameters of spatiotemporally
  varying processes, forcing the adoption of model-free control architectures. This
  comes at the cost of losing any robustness guarantees, and implies a need for extensive
  real-life testing. In recent years, however, infrared cameras and other thermographic
  equipment have become readily applicable to these processes, allowing for a real-time,
  non-invasive means of sensing the thermal state of a process. In this work, we present
  a novel physics-based approach to learning a thermal process's dynamics directly
  from such real-time thermographic data, while focusing attention on regions with
  high thermal activity. We call this process, which applies to any higher-dimensional
  scalar field, attention-based noise robust averaging (ANRA). Given a partial-differential
  equation model structure, we show that our approach is robust against noise, and
  can be used to initialize optimization routines to further refine parameter estimates.
  We demonstrate our method on several simulation examples, as well as by applying
  it to electrosurgical thermal response data on in vivo porcine skin tissue.
