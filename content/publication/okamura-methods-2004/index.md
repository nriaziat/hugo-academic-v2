abstract: Teleoperated minimally invasive surgical robots can significantly enhance
  a surgeon's accuracy, dexterity and visualization. However, current commercially
  available systems do not include significant haptic (force and tactile) feedback
  to the operator. This paper describes experiments to characterize this problem,
  as well as several methods to provide haptic feedback in order to improve surgeon's
  performance. There exist a variety of sensing and control methods that enable haptic
  feedback, although a number of practical considerations, e.g. cost, complexity and
  biocompatibility, present significant challenges. The ability of teleoperated robot-assisted
  surgical systems to measure and display haptic information leads to a number of
  additional exciting clinical and scientific opportunities, such as active operator
  assistance through \"virtual fixtures\" and the automatic acquisition of tissue
  properties.
