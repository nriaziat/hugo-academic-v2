abstract: Electrosurgical radio-frequency heating of tissue is widely applied in minimally
  invasive surgical procedures to dissect tissue with simultaneous coagulation to
  obtain hemostasis. The tissue effect depends on the cumulative heating that occurs
  in the vicinity of the moving blade electrode. In this work, a continuum thermomechanical
  model based on mixture theory, which accounts for the multiphase nature of soft
  hydrated tissues and includes transport and evaporation losses, is used to capture
  the transient heating effect of a moving electrode. The model takes into account
  the dependence of electrical conductivity and the evaporation rate on the water
  content in the tissue, as it changes in response to heating. Temperature prediction
  is validated with mean experimental temperature measured during in situ experiments
  performed on porcine liver tissue at different power settings of the electrosurgical
  unit. The model is shown to closely capture the temperature variation in the tissue
  for three distinct scenarios; with no visible cutting or coagulation damage at a
  low 10 W power setting, with coagulation damage but no tissue cutting at an intermediate
  power setting of 25 W, and with both coagulation and tissue cutting at a higher
  power setting of 50 W. Furthermore, an Arrhenius model is shown to capture tissue
  damage observed in the experiments. Increase in applied power was found to correlate
  with tissue cutting and concentrated damage near the electrode, but had little effect
  on the observed coagulation damage width. The proposed model provides, for the first
  time, an accurate tool for predicting temperature rise and evolving damage resulting
  from a moving electrode in pure-cut electrosurgery.
