abstract: This article is the first of a two-part series intended as an introduction
  to haptic interfaces. Together they provide a general introduction to haptic interfaces,
  their construction, and application design. Haptic interfaces comprise hardware
  and software components aiming at providing computer-controlled, programmable sensations
  of mechanical nature, i.e., pertaining to the sense of touch. In Part I, we describe
  methods that have been researched and developed to date to achieve the generation
  of haptic sensations, the means to construct experimental devices of modest complexity,
  and the software components needed to drive them. In Part II of this series, we
  will describe some basic concepts of haptic interaction design together with several
  interesting applications based on this technology.
