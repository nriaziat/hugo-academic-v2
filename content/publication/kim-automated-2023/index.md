abstract: The first step in establishing a retrofit strategy for an existing building
  is to identify the type of thermal defects in the building envelope. Infrared thermography
  is mainly used to detect thermal defects. However, the diagnosis results are subjectively
  influenced by the auditor’s experience. This study proposes a method for classifying
  thermal defects into material-related thermal bridges, geometrical thermal bridges,
  air leakages, and other thermal defects via thermal and visible images. To verify
  the performance of the proposed method, a field experiment was performed on a building
  in which thermal defects occurred. The results of the field experiment showed that
  the F-scores of the proposed method were 0.9707 for air leakage, 0.9000 for a material-related
  thermal bridge, 0.9775 for a geometrical thermal bridge, and 0.9228 for other defects.
  The results of this study show the potential for automatically classifying various
  types of defects that occur in building envelopes. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading
