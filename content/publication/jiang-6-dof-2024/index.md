abstract: Environmental conditions such as wind and ground traffic introduce motion
  in camera measurement systems and affect measurement accuracy. Conventional camera
  motion correction methods track static reference points with one or multiple cameras,
  reducing applicability. This study proposes a novel 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) camera
  motion correction method using only an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. A
  Kalman filter is adopted as a data fusion method to estimate the camera orientation
  and translation using IMU data. Six pinhole camera models are built to evaluate
  and correct 6-DOF camera motions. The motion correction efficiency and robustness
  are tested for different object distances and focal lengths of optical lenses. The
  motion correction ratio is statistically analysed and reaches approximately 80%.
  The object distance has little effect on the motion correction ratio. The rotation-induced
  pixel movement is independent of the object distance. More than 90% of the pixel
  movement noise is caused by camera rotation. The translation-induced pixel movement
  is inversely correlated with the object distance.
