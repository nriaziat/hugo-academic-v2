abstract: Although robotic telemanipulation has always been a key technology for the
  nuclear industry, little advancement has been seen over the last decades. Despite
  complex remote handling requirements, simple mechanically linked master-slave manipulators
  still dominate the field. Nonetheless, there is a pressing need for more effective
  robotic solutions able to significantly speed up the decommissioning of legacy radioactive
  waste. This paper describes a novel haptic shared-control approach for assisting
  a human operator in the sort and segregation of different objects in a cluttered
  and unknown environment. A three-dimensional scan of the scene is used to generate
  a set of potential grasp candidates on the objects at hand. These grasp candidates
  are then used to generate guiding haptic cues, which assist the operator in approaching
  and grasping the objects. The haptic feedback is designed to be smooth and continuous
  as the user switches from a grasp candidate to the next one, or from one object
  to another one, avoiding any discontinuity or abrupt changes. To validate our approach,
  we carried out two human-subject studies, enrolling 15 participants. We registered
  an average improvement of 20.8%, 20.1%, and 32.5% in terms of completion time, linear
  trajectory, and perceived effectiveness, respectively, between the proposed approach
  and standard teleoperation.
