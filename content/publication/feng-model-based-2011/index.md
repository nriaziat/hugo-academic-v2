abstract: In this article, the major idea and mathematical aspects of model-based
  planning and real-time predictive control for laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT)
  are presented. In particular, a computational framework and its major components
  developed by authors in recent years are reviewed. The framework provides the backbone
  for not only treatment planning but also real-time surgical monitoring and control
  with a focus on MR thermometry enabled predictive control and applications to image-guided
  LITT, or MRgLITT. Although this computational framework is designed for LITT in
  treating prostate cancer, it is further applicable to other thermal therapies in
  focal lesions induced by radio-frequency (RF), microwave and high-intensity-focused
  ultrasound (HIFU). Moreover, the model-based dynamic closed-loop predictive control
  algorithms in the framework, facilitated by the coupling of mathematical modelling
  and computer simulation with real-time imaging feedback, has great potential to
  enable a novel methodology in thermal medicine. Such technology could dramatically
  increase treatment efficacy and reduce morbidity.
