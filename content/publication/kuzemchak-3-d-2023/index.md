abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most ubiquitous forms of cancer that is often
  overdiagnosed or missed by traditional diagnostic techniques. Bioimpedance spectroscopy
  (BIS) is a technology that aims to take advantage of the variations in electrical
  properties of tissue to identify ectopic formations. It is difficult to develop
  BIS technologies without obtaining tumor tissue samples. One solution is to use
  a “tissue phantom,” a synthetic structure that mimics the properties of tissue.
  Current solutions using natural biomaterials, such as gelatin, have not been able
  to create complex tissue geometries that are vital to honing BIS diagnostics. However,
  semi-synthetic polymers, such has gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), offer the benefits
  of possessing similar electrical properties to their respective source biomaterial
  while being 3D printable. In this work, we first measured the impedance of porcine
  dermal tissue. We then applied these impedance measurements to create an electrically
  accurate tissue phantom using a photocurable hydrogel, GelMA, and varying concentrations
  of NaCl, aluminum powder, and titanium dioxide powder.
