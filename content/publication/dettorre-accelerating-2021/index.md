abstract: Robotic-assisted surgery is now well-established in clinical practice and
  has become the gold standard clinical treatment option for several clinical indications.
  The field of robotic-assisted surgery is expected to grow substantially in the next
  decade with a range of new robotic devices emerging to address unmet clinical needs
  across different specialities. A vibrant surgical robotics research community is
  pivotal for conceptualizing such new systems as well as for developing and training
  the engineers and scientists to translate them into practice. The da Vinci Research
  Kit (dVRK), an academic and industry collaborative effort to re-purpose decommissioned
  da Vinci surgical systems (Intuitive Surgical Inc, CA, USA) as a research platform
  for surgical robotics research, has been a key initiative for addressing a barrier
  to entry for new research groups in surgical robotics. In this paper, we present
  an extensive review of the publications that have been facilitated by the dVRK over
  the past decade. We classify research efforts into different categories and outline
  some of the major challenges and needs for the robotics community to maintain this
  initiative and build upon it.
