abstract: 'Background: Electrosurgery is one of the most commonly used energy systems
  in laparoscopic surgery. Two major categories of potential complications related
  to electrosurgery in laparoscopy are mechanical trauma and electrothermal injury.
  The latter can result from unrecognized energy transfer in the operational field
  or, less commonly, to unnoticed stray current outside the laparoscopic field of
  view. Stray current can result from insulation failure, direct coupling, or capacitive
  coupling. Methods: We reviewed the literature concerning essential biophysics of
  electrosurgery, including electrosurgical waveform differentiation, tissue effect,
  and variables that determine tissue effect. The incidence of electrosurgical injuries
  and possible mechanisms responsible for the injuries are discussed. Different types
  of injuries may result in different clinical manifestations and histopathological
  findings. Gross and microscopic pathological check-ups of the injury sites may distinguish
  between different mechanisms, and thus provide further clues postoperatively. Results:
  Several recommended practices are proposed to avoid electrosurgical injury laparoscopically.
  To achieve electrosurgical safety and to prevent electrosurgical injuries, the surgical
  team should have a good understanding of the biophysics of electrosurgery, the basis
  of equipment and general tissue effects, as well as the surgeonâ€™s spatial orientation
  and hand-eye coordination. Some intraoperative adjuvant procedures and newly developed
  safety devices have become available may aid to improve electrosurgical safety.
  Conclusions: Knowledge of the biophysics of electrosurgery and the mechanisms of
  electrosurgical injury is important in recognizing potential complications of electrosurgery
  in laparoscopy. Procedures for prevention, intraoperative adjuvant maneuvers, early
  recognition of the injury with in-time salvage treatment, and alertness to postoperative
  warning signs can help reduce such complications.'
