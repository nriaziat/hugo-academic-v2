abstract: In this paper, we present a new method to control the thermal stimulation
  of skin during a photorejuvenation procedure. The proposed method can precisely
  administer the thermal dose while controlling the tissue’s temperature under a safe
  limit. For that, a model-based treatment controller is developed and evaluated on
  a three-dimensional biophysicsbased numerical model of skin; A hardware implementation
  is experimentally tested on a gelatin-based phantom tissue subjected to pulsed laser
  irradiation. A key component of our method is the use of a new thermal dose metric
  that enables quantifying and controlling the skin photo-rejuvenation process; This
  metric represents a suitable alternative to the lack of consensus on the metrics
  used by the photodermatology community. The reported experiments demonstrate that
  the developed controller endowed with the proposed dose unit can automatically deliver
  a prescribed laser irradiation and thermal dose over the tissue surface. The signiﬁcance
  of our result is that it provides a control-theoretic framework to automate skin
  photorejuvenation treatments with thermal-guided robots. This approach has the potential
  to introduce standards in the automation of these types of photo-treatments.
