abstract: 'Projection-based adaptation laws are used quite often to prevent parameter
  drift in adaptation schemes. In this appendix we introduce some definitions and
  facts from convex analysis and present some properties of the projection operator
  used throughout the book. Definition B.1 (see [24]) Ω ⊆ ℝn is a convex set if for
  all x, y ∈ Ω the following holds:  λx+ ( 1 − λ ) y ∈ Ω , ∀λ∈ [ 0 , 1 ]  . The illustrations
  of convex and nonconvex sets are shown in Figure B.1. Definition B.2 ƒ : ℝn → ℝ
  is a convex function, if for all x, y ∈ ℝn the following holds: ƒƒƒ       ƒ ( λ
  x + ( 1 − λ ) y ) ≤ λ ƒ ( x ) + ( 1 − λ ) ƒ ( y ) , ∀λ∈ [ 0 1 ]  . A sketch of a
  convex function is presented in Figure B.2. Lemma B.1 Let ƒ : ℝn → ℝ be a convex
  function. Then for arbitrary constant δ, the set Ωδ ≜ θ ∈ ℝn∣ƒ(θ) ≤ δ is convex.
  The set Ωδ is called a sublevel set. The proof of this lemma can be found in [24].
  Lemma B.2 Let ƒ : ℝn → ℝ be a continuously differentiable convex function. Choose
  a constant δ and consider the convex set Ωδ ≜ θ ∈ ℝn∣ƒ(θ) ≤ δ.'
