abstract: 'Untethered miniature robotics have recently shown promising results in
  several scenarios at the microscale, such as targeted drug delivery, microassembly,
  and biopsy procedures. However, the vast majority of these small-scale robots have
  very limited manipulation capabilities, and none of the steering systems currently
  available enables humans to intuitively and effectively control dexterous miniaturized
  robots in a remote environment. In this paper, we present an innovative microteleoperation
  system with haptic assistance for the intuitive steering and control of miniaturized
  self-folding soft magnetic grippers in 2-D space. The soft grippers can be wirelessly
  positioned using weak magnetic fields and opened/closed by changing their temperature.
  An image-guided algorithm tracks the position of the controlled miniaturized gripper
  in the remote environment. A haptic interface provides the human operator with compelling
  haptic sensations about the interaction between the gripper and the environment
  as well as enables the operator to intuitively control the target position and grasping
  configuration of the gripper. Finally, magnetic and thermal control systems regulate
  the position and grasping configuration of the gripper. The viability of the proposed
  approach is demonstrated through two experiments involving 26 human subjects. Providing
  haptic stimuli elicited statistically significant improvements in the performance
  of the considered navigation and micromanipulation tasks.Note to Practitioners -
  The ability to accurately and intuitively control the motion of miniaturized grippers
  in remote environments can open new exciting possibilities in the fields of minimally
  invasive surgery, micromanipulation, biopsy, and drug delivery. This paper presents
  a microteleoperation system with haptic assistance through which a clinician can
  easily control the motion and open/close capability of miniaturized wireless soft
  grippers. It introduces the underlying autonomous magnetic and thermal control systems,
  their interconnection with the master haptic interface, and an extensive evaluation
  in two real-world scenarios: 1) following of a predetermined trajectory and 2) pick-and-place
  task of a microscopic object.'
