abstract: We propose a flexible technique to easily calibrate a camera. It only requires
  the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations.
  Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not
  be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of
  a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum
  likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test
  the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical
  techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes,
  the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision
  one more step from laboratory environments to real world use.
