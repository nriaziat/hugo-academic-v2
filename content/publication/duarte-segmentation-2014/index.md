abstract: Biomedical techniques and applications are being developed and placed at
  the service of clinicians. An example is medical thermography, which is being used
  more often in the detection of certain diseases and also in pain distribution. Current
  thermography processing software has some limitations mainly because it is developed
  for general applications and does not allow the identification of a Region Of Interest
  (ROI) with a specific anatomic shape. Current commercial software usually uses regular
  prismatic shapes for the definition of these regions, such as, rectangles, squares,
  circles and/or ellipse that poorly define complex geometric regions. These shapes
  present limitations when they do not fit with the complex geometric shape of the
  area that is to be characterized, either by the exclusion or the inclusion of irrelevant
  data in the evaluation of the thermal images. This particular limitation is observed
  no matter how accurate the definition of the ROI is. In order to improve characterization
  of thermal images, a computational application was developed. The limitations of
  existing software applications was overcome by designing an application that allows
  choosing any ROI, independently of its geometric shape and optimize it for further
  processing. This research work presents several segmentation algorithms and a comparison
  of untreated and optimized ROI's.
