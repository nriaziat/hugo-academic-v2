abstract: 'Shared control, which permits a human operator and an autonomous controller
  to share the control of a telerobotic system, can reduce the operator’s workload
  and/or improve performances during the execution of tasks. Due to the great beneﬁts
  of combining the human intelligence with the higher power/precision abilities of
  robots, the shared control architecture occupies a wide spectrum among telerobotic
  systems. Although various shared control strategies have been proposed, a systematic
  overview to tease out the relation among different strategies is still absent. This
  survey, therefore, aims to provide a big picture for existing shared control strategies.
  To achieve this, we propose a categorization method and classify the shared control
  strategies into 3 categories: Semi-Autonomous control (SAC), State-Guidance Shared
  Control (SGSC), and State-Fusion Shared Control (SFSC), according to the different
  sharing ways between human operators and autonomous controllers. The typical scenarios
  in using each category are listed and the advantages/disadvantages and open issues
  of each category are discussed. Then, based on the overview of the existing strategies,
  new trends in shared control strategies, including the “autonomy from learning”
  and the “autonomy-levels adaptation,” are summarized and discussed.'
