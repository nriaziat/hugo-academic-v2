abstract: Three-dimensional geometrical models with incorporated surface temperature
  data provide important information for various applications such as medical imaging,
  energy auditing, and intelligent robots. In this paper we present a robust method
  for mobile and real-time 3D thermographic reconstruction through depth and thermal
  sensor fusion. A multimodal imaging device consisting of a thermal camera and a
  RGB-D sensor is calibrated geometrically and used for data capturing. Based on the
  underlying principle that temperature information remains robust against illumination
  and viewpoint changes, we present a Thermal-guided Iterative Closest Point (T-ICP)
  methodology to facilitate reliable 3D thermal scanning applications. The pose of
  sensing device is initially estimated using correspondences found through maximizing
  the thermal consistency between consecutive infrared images. The coarse pose estimate
  is further refined by finding the motion parameters that minimize a combined geometric
  and thermographic loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that complimentary
  information captured by multimodal sensors can be utilized to improve performance
  of 3D thermographic reconstruction. Through effective fusion of thermal and depth
  data, the proposed approach generates more accurate 3D thermal models using significantly
  less scanning data.
