abstract: Surgical resection is the current clinical standard of care for treating
  squamous cell carcinoma. Maintaining an adequate tumor resection margin is the key
  to a good surgical outcome, but tumor edge delineation errors are inevitable with
  manual surgery due to difficulty in visualization and hand-eye coordination. Surgical
  automation is a growing field of robotics to relieve surgeon burdens and to achieve
  a consistent and potentially better surgical outcome. This paper reports a novel
  robotic supervised autonomous electrosurgery technique for soft tissue resection
  achieving millimeter accuracy. The tumor resection procedure is decomposed to the
  subtask level for a more direct understanding and automation. A 4-DOF suction system
  is developed, and integrated with a 6-DOF electrocautery robot to perform resection
  experiments. A novel near-infrared fluorescent marker is manually dispensed on cadaver
  samples to define a pseudotumor, and intraoperatively tracked using a dual-camera
  system. The autonomous dual-robot resection cooperation workflow is proposed and
  evaluated in this study. The integrated system achieves autonomous localization
  of the pseudotumor by tracking the near-infrared marker, and performs supervised
  autonomous resection in cadaver porcine tongues (N =3). The three pseudotumors were
  successfully removed from porcine samples. The evaluated average surface and depth
  resection errors are 1.19 and 1.83mm, respectively. This work is an essential step
  towards autonomous tumor resections.
