 abstract = {Surgical resection is the current clinical standard of care for treating squamous cell carcinoma. Maintaining an adequate tumor resection margin is the key to a good surgical outcome, but tumor edge delineation errors are inevitable with manual surgery due to difficulty in visualization and hand-eye coordination. Surgical automation is a growing field of robotics to relieve surgeon burdens and to achieve a consistent and potentially better surgical outcome. This paper reports a novel robotic supervised autonomous electrosurgery technique for soft tissue resection achieving millimeter accuracy. The tumor resection procedure is decomposed to the subtask level for a more direct understanding and automation. A 4-DOF suction system is developed, and integrated with a 6-DOF electrocautery robot to perform resection experiments. A novel near-infrared fluorescent marker is manually dispensed on cadaver samples to define a pseudotumor, and intraoperatively tracked using a dual-camera system. The autonomous dual-robot resection cooperation workflow is proposed and evaluated in this study. The integrated system achieves autonomous localization of the pseudotumor by tracking the near-infrared marker, and performs supervised autonomous resection in cadaver porcine tongues (N =3). The three pseudotumors were successfully removed from porcine samples. The evaluated average surface and depth resection errors are 1.19 and 1.83mm, respectively. This work is an essential step towards autonomous tumor resections.},
