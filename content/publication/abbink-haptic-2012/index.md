abstract: Literature points to persistent issues in human-automation interaction,
  which are caused either when the human does not understand the automation or when
  the automation does not understand the human. Design guidelines for human-automation
  interaction aim to avoid such issues and commonly agree that the human should have
  continuous interaction and communication with the automation system and its authority
  level and should retain final authority. This paper argues that haptic shared control
  is a promising approach to meet the commonly voiced design guidelines for human-automation
  interaction, especially for automotive applications. The goal of the paper is to
  provide evidence for this statement, by discussing several realizations of haptic
  shared control found in literature. We show that literature provides ample experimental
  evidence that haptic shared control can lead to short-term performance benefits
  (e.g., faster and more accurate vehicle control; lower levels of control effort;
  reduced demand for visual attention). We conclude that although the continuous intuitive
  physical interaction inherent in haptic shared control is expected to reduce long-term
  issues with human-automation interaction, little experimental evidence for this
  is provided. Therefore, future research on haptic shared control should focus more
  on issues related to long-term use such as trust, overreliance, dependency on the
  system, and retention of skills.
