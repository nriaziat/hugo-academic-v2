abstract: 'Introduction: Electrosurgery is used in 80% of surgical procedures. The
  technique allows surgeons to skilfully dissect tissues and achieve haemostasis.
  Since improper use of electrosurgery can lead to serious adverse events, training
  is required to potentially reduce the number and severity of these events. In this
  study we evaluate education and training in electrosurgery for surgical residents.
  Material and methods: Residents from six surgical subspecialties in the Netherlands
  were invited to anonymously complete a digital questionnaire about training, supervision
  and adverse events regarding electrosurgery. Results: Of the 197 respondents, 69%
  had received some form of training; mostly a single theoretical lecture. The feeling
  of competence in theory and practical skills was positively rated by 39% and 71%,
  respectively. Moreover, 35% judged the theoretical knowledge of their supervisors
  as insufficient and 65% changed their electrosurgical application technique to the
  preference of the supervisor. 30% of the residents had encountered a serious adverse
  event (e.g., burn wounds) related to the application of electrosurgery. Conclusions:
  The training of residents in theoretical aspects of electrosurgery is limited. Residents
  are not satisfied with the acquired theoretical knowledge of themselves and of their
  supervisors. Since adverse events related to electrosurgery occur frequently, more
  extensive education for both residents and their supervisors is needed to enhance
  patient safety.'
