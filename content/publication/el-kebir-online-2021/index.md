abstract: The first closed-loop control of electrosurgical power satisfying a specified
  tissue damage bound along the desired tissue dissection path is presented. The damage
  is represented by the 82 °C isotherm corresponding to the admissible tissue denaturation
  front position in relation to that of the cutting probe tip. The front location
  is assessed in real time through the infrared temperature readings of the 40 °C
  isotherm tightly related to the emerging denaturing patch size around the moving
  probe tip. A control-oriented denaturing hypermodel and its recasting into a form
  amenable for use in a moving-horizon locally linear model predictive control law
  are presented. The optimal control action is determined by solving a compound model
  predictive control problem that targets a number of active one-dimensional domains.
  This model is obtained from an offline trained nonlinear autoregressive model with
  exogenous input. To enforce the safety constraints, a supervisor system precedes
  the path planning control law. This system prevents excessive denaturation by excluding
  certain system moves, and determines system termination conditions. We experimentally
  demonstrate the system’s performance in two different line-cutting tasks on ex vivo
  porcine tissue with a desired denaturation front.
