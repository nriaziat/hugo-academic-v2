 abstract = {Active 3D thermography combines 3D shape and active thermography. Thus, it enables the provision of the intuitive thermographic inspection results for composite parts with a complex geometry. However, conventional 3D thermography acquires thermographic information and 3D shape through at least two independent sensors and requires complex cross-modal image registration algorithm based on the keypoint detection and matching. In this paper, an active 3D thermography system is proposed using only one thermal camera for moving objects. This system does not require an independent 3D sensor while the thermal camera acts as the 3D sensor. Nature behind that is that a mathematical model is proposed to unify the line scanning thermography and laser triangulation in the dynamic scanning process, taking a line laser as both heat excitation for active thermography and spatial coding for 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, the model enables the feature-free registration of thermogram sequence and 3D shape, so that the registration is fast and robust without keypoint features. The experiments on standard height specimens, 3D printing glass fiber composites, and carbon fiber intake tube have shown the error is calibrated within 0.25 mm in the range of 1 mm to 150 mm and evidenced the capability for sub-surface defects detection.},
