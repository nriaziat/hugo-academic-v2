abstract: Active 3D thermography combines 3D shape and active thermography. Thus,
  it enables the provision of the intuitive thermographic inspection results for composite
  parts with a complex geometry. However, conventional 3D thermography acquires thermographic
  information and 3D shape through at least two independent sensors and requires complex
  cross-modal image registration algorithm based on the keypoint detection and matching.
  In this paper, an active 3D thermography system is proposed using only one thermal
  camera for moving objects. This system does not require an independent 3D sensor
  while the thermal camera acts as the 3D sensor. Nature behind that is that a mathematical
  model is proposed to unify the line scanning thermography and laser triangulation
  in the dynamic scanning process, taking a line laser as both heat excitation for
  active thermography and spatial coding for 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, the model
  enables the feature-free registration of thermogram sequence and 3D shape, so that
  the registration is fast and robust without keypoint features. The experiments on
  standard height specimens, 3D printing glass fiber composites, and carbon fiber
  intake tube have shown the error is calibrated within 0.25 mm in the range of 1
  mm to 150 mm and evidenced the capability for sub-surface defects detection.
