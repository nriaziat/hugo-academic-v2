abstract: Flap failure in free-tissue transfer relates strongly to technical failure
  of the anastomosis or to kinking as well as to external compression of the donor
  or recipient vessels. Intraoperative monitoring of flap perfusion has shown to prevent
  flap failure. This prospective, clinical study presents the results of intraoperative
  dynamic infrared thermography as a novel method to monitor reperfusion indirectly
  in 10 free flaps. This noninvasive technique provided a fast and reliable method
  to register partial or total arterial occlusion due to anastomotic failure, as well
  as due to external compression or kinking of the vessels. The dynamic infrared image
  sequences showed an improved rate and pattern of rewarming of the flap after an
  additional venous anastomosis was opened. The state of reperfusion of the flap at
  the end of the operation could easily be determined. The authors conclude that dynamic
  infrared thermography provides the surgeon with valuable information on flap reperfusion
  during free flap surgery.
