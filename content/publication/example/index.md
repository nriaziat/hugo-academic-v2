abstract: The Hapkit is an open-source kinesthetic device used by educators to
  teach fundamentals of haptic interaction. Despite its pedagogical benefits, it
  cannot showcase ungrounded interactions. Here, we introduce an ungrounded
  Hapkit variant that generates moments at the wrist as the user interacts with
  a virtual environment. The device utilizes existing Hapkit hardware with 3D
  printed modifications to enable ungrounded kinesthetic feedback. We developed
  Arduino and Processing code that simulates ungrounded impacts, such as hitting
  a tennis ball, to demonstrate functionality. This device can serve as a
  valuable pedagogical tool in conjunction with the well-established Hapkit.
