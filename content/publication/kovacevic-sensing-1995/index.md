abstract: Weld pool geometry is a crucial factor in determining welding quality, especially
  in the case of sheet welding. Its feedback control should be a fundamental requirement
  for automated welding. However, the real-time precise measurement of pool geometry
  is a difficult procedure. It has been shown that vision sensing is a promising approach
  for monitoring the weld pool geometry. Quality images that can be processed in real-time
  to detect the pool geometry are acquired by using a high shutter speed camera assisted
  with nitrogen laser as an illumination source. However, during practical welding,
  impurities or oxides existing on the pool surface complicate image processing. The
  image features are analyzed and utilized for effectively processing the image. It
  is shown that the proposed algorithm can always detect the pool boundary with sufficient
  accuracy in less than 100 ms. Based on this measuring technique, a robust adaptive
  system has been developed to control the pool area. Experiments show that the proposed
  control system can overcome the influence caused by various disturbances.
