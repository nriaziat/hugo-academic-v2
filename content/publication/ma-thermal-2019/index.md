abstract: The thermal damage of a three-dimensional bio-tissue model irradiated by
  a movable laser beam was studied in this work. By employing the DPL biological heat
  conduction model and Henriquesâ€™ thermal damage assessment model, the distribution
  of burn damage of vivo human tissue during laser therapy was analytically obtained.
  The influences of laser moving velocity, laser spot size, phase lags of heat flux
  and temperature gradient were discussed. It was found that the laser moving speed
  and the laser spot size greatly influence the thermal damage degree by affecting
  the energy concentration degree. The increases of the laser moving speed and laser
  spot size can enlarge the irradiated region and reduce the burn degree. A greater
  phase lag of temperature gradient led to lower accumulation of thermal energy and
  lower burn degree. However, the increment of heat flux phase lag leads to the thermal
  energy accumulation and more serious burn degree in the irradiated region.
