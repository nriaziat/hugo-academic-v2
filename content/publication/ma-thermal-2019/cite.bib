 abstract = {The thermal damage of a three-dimensional bio-tissue model irradiated by a movable laser beam was studied in this work. By employing the DPL biological heat conduction model and Henriquesâ€™ thermal damage assessment model, the distribution of burn damage of vivo human tissue during laser therapy was analytically obtained. The influences of laser moving velocity, laser spot size, phase lags of heat flux and temperature gradient were discussed. It was found that the laser moving speed and the laser spot size greatly influence the thermal damage degree by affecting the energy concentration degree. The increases of the laser moving speed and laser spot size can enlarge the irradiated region and reduce the burn degree. A greater phase lag of temperature gradient led to lower accumulation of thermal energy and lower burn degree. However, the increment of heat flux phase lag leads to the thermal energy accumulation and more serious burn degree in the irradiated region.},
