abstract: 'Background: Bowel injury is a rare but serious complication of laparoscopic
  surgery. This review examines the incidence, location, time of diagnosis, causative
  instruments, management and mortality of laparoscopy-induced bowel injury. Methods:
  The review was carried out using the MeSH browser within PubMed. The keywords used
  were ‘laparoscopy/adverse effects’ and ‘bowel perforation’. Additional articles
  were sourced from references within the studies found in the PubMed search. Results:
  The incidence of laparoscopy-induced gastrointestinal injury was 0·13 per cent (430
  of 329 935) and of bowel perforation 0·22 per cent (66 of 29 532). The small intestine
  was most frequently injured (55·8 per cent), followed by the large intestine (38·6
  per cent). In at least 66·8 per cent of bowel injuries the diagnosis was made during
  the laparoscopy or within 24 h thereafter. A trocar or Veress needle caused the
  most bowel injuries (41·8 per cent), followed by a coagulator or laser (25·6 per
  cent). In 68·9 per cent of instances of bowel injury, adhesions or a previous laparotomy
  were noted. Management was mainly by laparotomy (78·6 per cent). The mortality rate
  associated with laparoscopy-induced bowel injury was 3·6 per cent. Conclusion: At
  0·13 per cent, the incidence of laparoscopy-induced bowel injury is small and such
  injury is usually discovered during the operation. Nevertheless, laparoscopy-induced
  bowel injury is associated with a high mortality rate of 3·6 per cent.'
