 abstract = {The SAGES Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE) program accompanied by a bench-top simulation has shown to improve knowledge of the safe use of energy devices. However, there are significant barriers and costs associated with delivering an effective structured simulation curriculum to a widespread international audience. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if bench-top simulation FUSE curriculum through telementoring is as effective as a live-in house proctor for electrosurgical training.},
