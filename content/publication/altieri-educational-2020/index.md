abstract: The SAGES Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE) program accompanied
  by a bench-top simulation has shown to improve knowledge of the safe use of energy
  devices. However, there are significant barriers and costs associated with delivering
  an effective structured simulation curriculum to a widespread international audience.
  The purpose of this study was to evaluate if bench-top simulation FUSE curriculum
  through telementoring is as effective as a live-in house proctor for electrosurgical
  training.
