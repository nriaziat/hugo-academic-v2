abstract: In this study, we present an intuitive machine learning-based approach to
  evaluate and interpret surgical skills level of a participant working with robotic
  platforms. The proposed method is domain-adapted, i.e., jointly utilizes an end-to-end
  learning approach for smoothness detection and domain knowledge-based metrics such
  as fluidity and economy of motion for extracting skills-related features within
  a given trajectory. An advantage of our approach compared to similar stochastic
  or deep learning models is its intuitive and transparent manner for extraction and
  visualization of skills-related features within the data. We illustrate the performance
  of our proposed method on trials of the JIGSAWS data set as well as our own experimental
  data gathered from Phantom Premium boldsymbol1.5A Haptic Device. This approach utilized
  boldsymbolttext-mathbf SNE technique and provides visualized low-dimensional representation
  for different trials that highlights nuanced information within the executive task
  and returns unusual or faulty trials as outliers far away from their normal skill
  or participant clusters. This information regarding the input trajectory can be
  used for evaluation and education applications such as learning curve analysis in
  surgical assessment and training programs.
