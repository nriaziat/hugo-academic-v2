abstract: Many surgical adverse events, such as bile duct injuries during laparoscopic
  cholecystectomy (LC), occur due to errors in visual perception and judgment. Artificial
  intelligence (AI) can potentially improve the quality and safety of surgery, such
  as through real-time intraoperative decision support. GoNoGoNet is a novel AI model
  capable of identifying safe (“Go”) and dangerous (“No-Go”) zones of dissection on
  surgical videos of LC. Yet, it is unknown how GoNoGoNet performs in comparison to
  expert surgeons. This study aims to evaluate the GoNoGoNet’s ability to identify
  Go and No-Go zones compared to an external panel of expert surgeons.
