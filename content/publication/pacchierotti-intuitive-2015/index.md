abstract: Self-propelled microrobots have recently shown promising results in several
  scenarios at the microscale, such as targeted drug delivery and micromanipulation
  of cells. However, none of the steering systems available in the literature enable
  humans to intuitively and effectively control these microrobots in the remote environment,
  which is a desirable feature. In this paper we present an innovative teleoperation
  system with force reflection that enables a human operator to intuitively control
  the positioning of a self-propelled microjet. A particle-filter-based visual tracking
  algorithm tracks at runtime the position of the microjet in the remote environment.
  A 6-degrees-of-freedom haptic interface then provides the human operator with compelling
  haptic feedback about the interaction between the controlled microjet and the environment,
  as well as enabling the operator to intuitively control the target position of the
  microjet. Finally, a wireless magnetic control system regulates the orientation
  of the microjet to reach the target point. The viability of the proposed approach
  is demonstrated through two experimentsz enrolling twenty-eight subjects. In both
  experiments providing haptic feedback significantly improved the performance and
  the perceived realism of the considered tasks.
