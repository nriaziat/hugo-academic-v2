abstract: While there are several tools to study learning styles of students, the
  visual-aural-read/write-kinesthetic (VARK) questionnaire is a simple, freely available,
  easy to administer tool that encourages students to describe their behavior in a
  manner they can identify with and accept. The aim is to understand the preferred
  sensory modality (or modalities) of students for learning. Teachers can use this
  knowledge to facilitate student learning. Moreover, students themselves can use
  this knowledge to change their learning habits. Five hundred undergraduate students
  belonging to two consecutive batches in their second year of undergraduate medical
  training were invited to participate in the exercise. Consenting students (415 students,
  83%) were administered a printed form of version 7.0 of the VARK questionnaire.
  Besides the questionnaire, we also collected demographic data, academic performance
  data (marks obtained in 10th and 12th grades and last university examination), and
  self-perceived learning style preferences. The majority of students in our study
  had multiple learning preferences (68.7%). The predominant sensory modality of learning
  was aural (45.5%) and kinesthetic (33.1%). The learning style preference was not
  influenced by either sex or previous academic performance. Although we use a combination
  of teaching methods, there has not been an active effort to determine whether these
  adequately address the different types of learners. We hope these data will help
  us better our course contents and make learning a more fruitful experience.
