abstract: Dexterous surgical activity is of interest to many researchers in human
  motion modeling. In this paper, we describe a dataset of surgical activities and
  release it for public use. The dataset was captured using the da Vinci Surgical
  System and consists of kinematic and video from eight surgeons with diﬀerent levels
  of skill performing ﬁve repetitions of three elementary surgical tasks on a bench-top
  model. The tasks, which include suturing, knot-tying and needle-passing, are standard
  components of most surgical skills training curricula. In addition to kinematic
  and video data captured from the da Vinci Surgical System, we are also releasing
  manual annotations of surgical gestures (atomic activity segments), surgical skill
  using global rating scores, a standardized cross-validation experimental setup,
  and a C++/Matlab toolkits for analyzing surgical gestures using hidden Markov models
  and using linear dynamical systems. We refer to the dataset as the JHU-ISI Gesture
  and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS) to indicate the collaboration between
  Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISI), Sunnyvale, CA,
  on collecting these data.
