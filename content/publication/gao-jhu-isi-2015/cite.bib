 abstract = {Dexterous surgical activity is of interest to many researchers in human motion modeling. In this paper, we describe a dataset of surgical activities and release it for public use. The dataset was captured using the da Vinci Surgical System and consists of kinematic and video from eight surgeons with diﬀerent levels of skill performing ﬁve repetitions of three elementary surgical tasks on a bench-top model. The tasks, which include suturing, knot-tying and needle-passing, are standard components of most surgical skills training curricula. In addition to kinematic and video data captured from the da Vinci Surgical System, we are also releasing manual annotations of surgical gestures (atomic activity segments), surgical skill using global rating scores, a standardized cross-validation experimental setup, and a C++/Matlab toolkits for analyzing surgical gestures using hidden Markov models and using linear dynamical systems. We refer to the dataset as the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS) to indicate the collaboration between Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISI), Sunnyvale, CA, on collecting these data.},
