abstract: While the traditional control of surgical robots relies on fully manual
  teleoperations, human-robot collaborative systems promise to address issues such
  as workspace constrains and laborious tasks. In particular, shared control can reduce
  the surgeon’s workload and improve the overall surgical performance by supporting
  the surgeon effort during movements while keeping them in charge of complex control
  phases. In this letter, we propose a segmentation of the bimanual peg transfer task
  that alternates manual and autonomous control correspondingly. The authority allocation
  in this shared control framework considers both the limitation of learning-based
  methods and the higher dexterity of humans during physical interaction. The motion
  and strategies are transferred from an expert human to a da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
  using an epsilon-greedy on a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm.
  The model generated enables to train an intelligent agent that can skillfully collaborate
  with the human operator during the surgical task. The proposed shared control framework
  is veriﬁed both on a virtual platform and then on a real dVRK to assess its usability
  and robustness. The results show that, compared to traditional teleoperation, our
  method can achieve faster and more consistent peg transfers. An analysis of the
  participants’ effort also reveals a signiﬁcantly lower perception of the workload.
