abstract: Recent research has shown the beneﬁt of framing problems of imitation learning
  as solutions to Markov Decision Problems. This approach reduces learning to the
  problem of recovering a utility function that makes the behavior induced by a near-optimal
  policy closely mimic demonstrated behavior. In this work, we develop a probabilistic
  approach based on the principle of maximum entropy. Our approach provides a well-deﬁned,
  globally normalized distribution over decision sequences, while providing the same
  performance guarantees as existing methods.
