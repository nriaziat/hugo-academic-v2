 abstract = {Wildlife monitoring is carried out for diverse reasons, and monitoring methods have gradually advanced through technological development. Direct field investigations have been replaced by remote monitoring methods, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become the most important tool for wildlife monitoring. Many previous studies on detecting wild animals have used RGB images acquired from UAVs, with most of the analyses depending on machine learning–deep learning (ML–DL) methods. These methods provide relatively accurate results, and when thermal sensors are used as a supplement, even more accurate detection results can be obtained through complementation with RGB images. However, because most previous analyses were based on ML–DL methods, a lot of time was required to generate training data and train detection models. This drawback makes ML–DL methods unsuitable for real-time detection in the field. To compensate for the disadvantages of the previous methods, this paper proposes a real-time animal detection method that generates a total of six applicable input images depending on the context and uses them for detection. The proposed method is based on the Sobel edge algorithm, which is simple but can detect edges quickly based on change values. The method can detect animals in a single image without training data. The fastest detection time per image was 0.033 s, and all frames of a thermal video could be analyzed. Furthermore, because of the synchronization of the properties of the thermal and RGB images, the performance of the method was above average in comparison with previous studies. With target images acquired at heights below 100 m, the maximum detection precision and detection recall of the most accurate input image were 0.804 and 0.699, respectively. However, the low resolution of the thermal sensor and its shooting height limitation were hindrances to wildlife detection. The aim of future research will be to develop a detection method that can improve these shortcomings.},
