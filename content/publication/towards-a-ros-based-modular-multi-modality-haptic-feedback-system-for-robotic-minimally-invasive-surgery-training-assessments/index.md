abstract: Current commercially available robotic minimally invasive surgery
  (RMIS) platforms provide no haptic feedback of tool interactions with the
  surgical environment. As a consequence, novice robotic surgeons must rely
  exclusively on visual feedback to sense their physical interactions with the
  surgical environment. This technical limitation can make it challenging and
  time-consuming to train novice surgeons to proficiency in RMIS. Extensive
  prior research has demonstrated that incorporating haptic feedback is
  effective at improving surgical training task performance. However, few
  studies have investigated the utility of providing feedback of multiple
  modalities of haptic feedback simultaneously (multi-modality haptic feedback)
  in this context, and these studies have presented mixed results regarding its
  efficacy. Furthermore, the inability to generalize and compare these mixed
  results has limited our ability to understand why they can vary significantly
  between studies. Therefore, we have developed a generalized, modular
  multi-modality haptic feedback and data acquisition framework leveraging the
  real-time data acquisition and streaming capabilities of the Robot Operating
  System (ROS). In our preliminary study using this system, participants
  complete a peg transfer task using a da Vinci robot while receiving haptic
  feedback of applied forces, contact accelerations, or both via custom
  wrist-worn haptic devices. Results highlight the capability of our system in
  running systematic comparisons between various single and dual-modality haptic
  feedback approaches.
