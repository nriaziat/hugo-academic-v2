abstract: In this paper, we deal with the solution of an inverse problem involving
  the real-time identification of a positiondependent transient heat flux, imposed
  on the top surface of a thin plate by a laser diode. Infrared thermography measurements
  of the temperature of the plate, at the same surface where the heat flux is imposed,
  are used in the inverse analysis. The physical problem involves two-dimensional
  transient heat conduction in a plate with constant thermophysical properties, initially
  at a uniform temperature. A partial lumping across the plate's thickness is used
  for the mathematical formulation of the physical problem. We use the Steady State
  Kalman Filter (SSKF) for the solution of the inverse problem in real-time. The Steady
  State Kalman Filter results are compared to those obtained with the Classical Kalman
  Filter (CKF), in experiments where a laser diode at the 830 nm wavelength is used
  to heat the samples.
