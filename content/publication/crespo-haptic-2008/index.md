abstract: "Haptic guidance can improve the immediate performance of a motor task by
  enforcing a desired pattern of kinematics, but several studies have found that it
  impairs motor learning. In this study, we studied whether guidance from a robotic
  steering wheel can improve one's short-term learning of steering a simulated vehicle.
  We developed a computer algorithm that adapted the firmness of the guidance based
  on ongoing error. Training with \\\"guidance-as-needed\\\" or \\\"fixed guidance\\\
  \" allowed participants to learn to steer without experiencing large errors and
  produced slightly better immediate retention than did training without guidance,
  apparently because participants were better able to learn when to initiate turns.
  Training with guidance-as-needed produced slightly better results than training
  with fixed guidance: the guidance-as-needed participants' errors were significantly
  smaller when guidance was removed. However, this difference quickly dissipated with
  more practice. We conclude that haptic guidance can benefit short-term learning
  of a steering-type task while also limiting performance errors during training."
