abstract: The benefits of electrosurgery have been acknowledged since the early 1920s,
  and nowadays more than 80% of surgical procedures involve devices that apply energy
  to tissues. Despite its widespread use, it is currently unknown how the operator’s
  choices with regard to instrument selection and application technique are related
  to complications. As such, the manner in which electrosurgery is applied can have
  a serious influence on the outcome of the procedure and the well-being of patients.
  The aim of this study is to investigate the variety of differences in usage of electrosurgical
  devices. Our approach is to measure these parameters to provide insight into application
  techniques. A sensor was developed that records the magnitude of electric current
  delivered to an electrosurgical device at a frequency of 10 Hz. The sensor is able
  to detect device activation times and a reliable estimate of the power-level settings.
  Data were recorded for 91 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed by different
  surgeons and residents. Results of the current measurement data show differences
  in the way electrosurgery is applied by surgeons and residents during a laparoscopic
  cholecystectomy. Variations are seen in the number of activations, the activation
  time, and the approach for removal of the gallbladder. Analysis showed that experienced
  surgeons have a longer activation time than residents (3.01 vs 1.41 seconds, P textless
  .001) and a lower number of activations (102 vs 123). This method offers the opportunity
  to relate application techniques to clinical outcome and to provide input for the
  development of a best practice model.
