 abstract = {Insulation failures, direct coupling, and capacitive coupling around active electrodes may cause serious burns and tissue damage to patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures. A coordinated team effort between perioperative nurses and surgeons can prevent life-threatening complications from laparoscopic electrosurgical procedures. Knowledge of the biophysics of electrosurgery, the mechanisms of electrosurgery complications, and prevention of patient injuries will empower surgical team members to provide quality outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures.
