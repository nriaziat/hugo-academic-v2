abstract: Insulation failures, direct coupling, and capacitive coupling around active
  electrodes may cause serious burns and tissue damage to patients undergoing laparoscopic
  procedures. A coordinated team effort between perioperative nurses and surgeons
  can prevent life-threatening complications from laparoscopic electrosurgical procedures.
  Knowledge of the biophysics of electrosurgery, the mechanisms of electrosurgery
  complications, and prevention of patient injuries will empower surgical team members
  to provide quality outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures. AORN
  J 62 (July 1995) 51â€“71.
