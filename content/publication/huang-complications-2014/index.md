abstract: Electrosurgery is widely used in laparoscopic surgeries. It is essential
  to understand the principles of using appropriate electric currents and techniques
  to achieve the desired tissue effect and avoid complications. We reviewed the literature
  concerning the incidence of electrosurgical injuries, the mechanisms of injury,
  and recognition and management of electrosurgical complications. Alertness to postoperative
  warning signs, patient education prior to discharge, and the detection of delayed
  manifestations with salvage maneuvers may minimize catastrophic complications.
