 abstract = {Electrosurgery is widely used in laparoscopic surgeries. It is essential to understand the principles of using appropriate electric currents and techniques to achieve the desired tissue effect and avoid complications. We reviewed the literature concerning the incidence of electrosurgical injuries, the mechanisms of injury, and recognition and management of electrosurgical complications. Alertness to postoperative warning signs, patient education prior to discharge, and the detection of delayed manifestations with salvage maneuvers may minimize catastrophic complications.},
