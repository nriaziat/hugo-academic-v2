 abstract = {Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has undergone rapid adoption in general surgery due to features such as threedimensional visualization, wrist dexterity, improved precision of movement, and operator ergonomics. While many surgical trainees encounter RAS during their residency, robotic skills training programs and curricula vary across institutions and there is broad variation in graduating general surgeonsâ€™ robotic proficiency levels. Due to a need for a formalized process to achieve competence on the robotic platform, simulation-based training has become instrumental in closing this gap as it provides training in a low-stakes environment while allowing the trainee to improve their psychomotor and basic procedural skills.},
