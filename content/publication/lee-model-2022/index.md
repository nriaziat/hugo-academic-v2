abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has undergone rapid adoption in general surgery
  due to features such as threedimensional visualization, wrist dexterity, improved
  precision of movement, and operator ergonomics. While many surgical trainees encounter
  RAS during their residency, robotic skills training programs and curricula vary
  across institutions and there is broad variation in graduating general surgeons’
  robotic proficiency levels. Due to a need for a formalized process to achieve competence
  on the robotic platform, simulation-based training has become instrumental in closing
  this gap as it provides training in a low-stakes environment while allowing the
  trainee to improve their psychomotor and basic procedural skills.
