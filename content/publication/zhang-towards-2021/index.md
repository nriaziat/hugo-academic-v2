abstract: In this paper, we present the development of a sensing system with the capability
  to compute multispectral point clouds in real-time. The proposed multi-eye sensor
  system effectively registers information from the visible, (long-wave) infrared,
  and ultraviolet spectrum to its depth sensing frame, thus enabling to measure a
  wider range of surface features that are otherwise hidden to the naked eye. For
  that, we designed a new cross-calibration apparatus that produces consistent features
  which can be sensed by each of the cameras, therefore, acting as a multispectral
  \"chessboard\". The performance of the sensor is evaluated with two different cases
  of studies, where we show that the proposed system can detect \"hidden\" features
  of a 3D environment.
