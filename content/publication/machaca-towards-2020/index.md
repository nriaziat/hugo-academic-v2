abstract: 'Humans normally integrate multiple haptic signals during dexterous manipulation
  with the natural limb. Operating telerobots such as surgical robots and upper-limb
  prostheses removes this multimodality feedback. While considerable research has
  focused on single-modality haptic feedback and discrete multimodality haptic feedback,
  little is known regarding the utility of continuous multimodality feedback. Here,
  we present an experimental framework designed to explore continuous multimodality
  haptic feedback for dexterous manipulation. Participants performed a grasp-and-hold
  task in a virtual environment with either direct or myoelectric control under different
  haptic feedback conditions: no feedback, vibrotactile feedback of object slip, squeeze
  feedback of grip force, and combined vibrotactile and squeeze feedback. Results
  from preliminary pilot studies highlight the gap in knowledge surrounding the potential
  utility of continuous multimodality feedback in differing telerobot control scenarios.'
