abstract: Automation has the potential to improve the standard of care but is difficult
  to realize due to perceptual challenges, especially in soft-tissue surgery. Machine
  learning can provide solutions, but typically requires large amounts of training
  data, which is time-consuming to collect. Even with shared platforms, hardware differences
  can prevent effective sharing of data between institutions. This letter proposes
  a standardized simulation platform for training and testing algorithms to control
  surgical robotic systems, which is built upon an open-source simulator, the Asynchronous
  Multi-Body Framework (AMBF), to enable quick prototyping of different scenes. An
  illustrative example of a suturing task on a phantom is presented and has formed
  the basis of a challenge, released to the community. The top-level contribution
  is the open-source release of a dynamic simulation environment that enables realistic
  suturing on a phantom, but supporting contributions include its extendable architectural
  design and a series of algorithmic optimizations to achieve real-time control and
  collision detection, realistic behavior of the needle and suture, and generation
  of multi-modal ground-truth data, including labeled depth data. These capabilities
  enable simulation-based surgical training and support research in machine learning
  for surgical scene perception and autonomous action.
