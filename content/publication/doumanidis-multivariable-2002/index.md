abstract: This research implements the newly introduced scan welding technique in
  processes with material deposition. A laboratory station is developed with robotic
  plasma-arc welding under infrared pyrometry sensing for thermal scanning, and with
  gas metal arc welding under laser profilometry feedback for material transfer. The
  dynamics of the weld profile geometry (i.e. the bead width and reinforcement height)
  are modeled experimentally with respect to the process conditions (weld speed and
  wire feed). This model serves as the basis for the development of a simple geometry
  feedback control scheme. A multivariable adaptive control system, based on a generalized
  one step ahead regulation algorithm is also established and validated experimentally.
  Application of such bead profile regulation is explored in multipass weld joining,
  orbital welding, coating hardfacing and rapid manufacturing methods.
