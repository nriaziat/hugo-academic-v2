 abstract = {We developed an augmented reality (AR) dental training simulator utilizing a haptic (force feedback) device. A number of dental procedures such as crown preparation and opening access to the pulp can be simulated with various shapes of dental drill. The system allows students to practise surgery in the correct postures as in the actual environment by combining 3D tooth and tool models upon the real-world view and displaying the result through a video see-through head mounted display (HMD). The system monitors the important features such as applied forces and tool movement that characterize the quality of the procedure. Automatic performance assessment is achieved by comparing outcome and process features of a student with the best matching expert. Moreover, we incorporated kinematic feedback and hand guidance by haptic device. The result from an initial evaluation shows that the simulator is promising for supplemental training.},
