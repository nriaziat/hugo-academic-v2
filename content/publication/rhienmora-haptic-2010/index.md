abstract: We developed an augmented reality (AR) dental training simulator utilizing
  a haptic (force feedback) device. A number of dental procedures such as crown preparation
  and opening access to the pulp can be simulated with various shapes of dental drill.
  The system allows students to practise surgery in the correct postures as in the
  actual environment by combining 3D tooth and tool models upon the real-world view
  and displaying the result through a video see-through head mounted display (HMD).
  The system monitors the important features such as applied forces and tool movement
  that characterize the quality of the procedure. Automatic performance assessment
  is achieved by comparing outcome and process features of a student with the best
  matching expert. Moreover, we incorporated kinematic feedback and hand guidance
  by haptic device. The result from an initial evaluation shows that the simulator
  is promising for supplemental training.
