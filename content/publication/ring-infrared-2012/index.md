abstract: This review describes the features of modern infrared imaging technology
  and the standardization protocols for thermal imaging in medicine. The technique
  essentially uses naturally emitted infrared radiation from the skin surface. Recent
  studies have investigated the influence of equipment and the methods of image recording.
  The credibility and acceptance of thermal imaging in medicine is subject to critical
  use of the technology and proper understanding of thermal physiology. Finally, we
  review established and evolving medical applications for thermal imaging, including
  inflammatory diseases, complex regional pain syndrome and Raynaud's phenomenon.
  Recent interest in the potential applications for fever screening is described,
  and some other areas of medicine where some research papers have included thermal
  imaging as an assessment modality. In certain applications thermal imaging is shown
  to provide objective measurement of temperature changes that are clinically significant.
