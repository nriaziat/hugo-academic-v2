 abstract = {Using the heat conduction equation, the temperature distribution caused by a three-dimensional moving heat source of constant energy-rate density is computed numerically. The results are given in a normalized form, depending only on the thermal constants of the material, on the normalised coordinates, the length to width ratio of the heat source and a velocity parameter. Additionally, analytical solutions are found for the special cases of very low and very high source velocities.},
