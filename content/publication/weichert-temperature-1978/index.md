abstract: Using the heat conduction equation, the temperature distribution caused
  by a three-dimensional moving heat source of constant energy-rate density is computed
  numerically. The results are given in a normalized form, depending only on the thermal
  constants of the material, on the normalised coordinates, the length to width ratio
  of the heat source and a velocity parameter. Additionally, analytical solutions
  are found for the special cases of very low and very high source velocities.
