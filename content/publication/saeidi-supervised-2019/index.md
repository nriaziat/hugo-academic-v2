abstract: Autonomous robotic surgery systems aim to improve patient outcomes by leveraging
  the repeatability and consistency of automation and also reducing human induced
  errors. However, intraoperative autonomous soft tissue tracking and robot control
  still remains a challenge due to the lack of structure, and high deformability of
  such tissues. In this paper, we take advantage of biocompatible Near-Infrared (NIR)
  marking methods and develop a supervised autonomous 3D path planning, filtering,
  and control strategy for our Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) to enable precise
  and consistent incisions on complex 3D soft tissues. Our experimental results on
  cadaver porcine tongue samples indicate that the proposed strategy reduces surface
  incision error and depth incision error by 40.03% and 51.5%, respectively, compared
  to a teleoperation strategy via da Vinci. Furthermore, compared to an autonomous
  path planning method with linear interpolation between the NIR markers, the proposed
  strategy reduces the incision depth error by 48.58% by taking advantage of 3D tissue
  surface information.
