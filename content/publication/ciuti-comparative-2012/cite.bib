 abstract = {Wireless capsule endoscopy offers significant advantages compared with traditional endoscopic procedures, since it limits the invasiveness of gastrointestinal tract screening and diagnosis. Moreover, active locomotion devices would allow endoscopy to be performed in a totally controlled manner, avoiding failures in the correct visualization of pathologies. Previous works demonstrated that magnetic locomotion through a robotic-aided platform would allow us to reach this goal reliably. In this paper, the authors present a comparative evaluation of control methodologies and user interfaces for a robotic-aided magnetic platform for capsule endoscopy, controlled through human-robot cooperative and teleoperated control algorithms. A detailed statistical analysis of significant control parameters was performed: teleoperated control is the more reliable control approach, and a serial kinematic haptic device results as the most suitable control interface to perform effective robotic-aided endoscopic procedures.},
