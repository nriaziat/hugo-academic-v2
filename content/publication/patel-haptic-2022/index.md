abstract: This article presents an overview of the current state of research and application
  of haptic (primarily kinesthetic) feedback and force-based teleoperation in the
  context of surgical robotics. Telerobotic surgery provides an approach for transferring
  the sensorimotor skills of a surgeon through a robotic platform to perform surgical
  intervention inside a patient’s body. Integration of advanced sensing and haptic
  technologies in telerobotic surgery can help to enhance the sensory awareness and
  motor accuracy of the surgeon, thereby leading to improved surgical procedures and
  outcomes for patients. The primary mode of sensory feedback has been through 3-D
  visual observation using stereo endoscopes. However, until recently, the sense of
  touch, i.e., haptics, has been missing in the commercial telesurgery robots approved
  for use in the operating room despite over two decades of research and development
  in the field of haptics for teleoperated systems (“telehaptics”). Research has shown
  that high-fidelity force feedback can enhance the performance of telesurgery and
  potential outcomes by enabling the surgeon to have a more natural feel of interaction
  between surgical tools and tissue as normally experienced during open surgery. Interaction
  forces, such as those generated during palpation of tissue, insertion of a needle,
  unintentional (and potentially unsafe) exertion of force by a tool, suture breakage,
  needle slippage, or tool interaction, are replaced by indirect (virtual) sensations,
  termed visual haptics, which provides an alternative to sensory compensation. Although
  there is a significant amount of literature supporting this benefit, there are still
  several important technical challenges in introducing haptics in telesurgery, including
  instrumentation, fidelity (transparency), stability, and modalities for force reflection,
  e.g., direct or indirect. This article examines these challenges and discusses recent
  work on haptics-based teleoperated surgical robotic systems.
