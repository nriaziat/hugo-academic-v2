abstract: This paper presents a novel multimodal training platform integrated with
  hand-over-hand (HOH) haptic guidance for dual-console surgical robotic systems such
  as the da Vinci Si system. The expert-in-the-loop (EIL) framework incorporates a
  fuzzy interface system in order to provide a trainee with adaptive authority over
  the procedure as well as hand-over-hand haptic guidance adjusted in real time based
  on the proficiency level of the trainee. The EIL expertise-oriented framework enables
  performance of a surgical procedure by an expert surgeon on a patient, while simultaneously
  providing a trainee at any stage of the motor-skills development with multimodal
  training without jeopardizing patient safety. Closed-loop stability of the system
  is investigated using the circle criterion and it is shown that the proposed architecture
  is unconditionally stable. Experimental evaluations are presented in support of
  the proposed platform through the implementation of a dual-console surgical setup
  consisting of the classic da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale,
  CA, USA) and the dV-Trainer master console (Mimic Technology, Inc., Seattle, WA,
  USA). To the best of our knowledge, the implemented setup is the first research
  platform for dual-console studies involving the classic da Vinci surgical system.
