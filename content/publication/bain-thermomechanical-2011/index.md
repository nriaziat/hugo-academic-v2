abstract: For several years, research work has been carried out at the University
  of Canterbury aimed at the development of a rapid prototyping and manufacturing
  process referred to as Robotic Foam Sculpting (RFS). This system uses a six-axis
  industrial robot and electrically-heated hot-wire and hot-blade tools to sculpt
  desired parts from blocks of polystyrene foam. The vision for this system is that
  it will be able to rapidly create large volume foam models at low cost, for a range
  of potential applications. Parts produced by the RFS system can potentially be used
  as investment casting patterns, cores for sculptures and architectural details,
  demonstration and testing models, wind tunnel test models, and many other potential
  applications. At the beginning of the work reported in this thesis, there was very
  little understanding of the nature of the surfaces produced by hot-tool cutting
  of foam, very little knowledge of the range of input cutting conditions that affected
  the surface quality, and almost no understanding of the relationships between the
  cutting strategy and the nature of the surfaces being produced. In addition, there
  was little evidence of published work on these subjects that was sufficiently robust
  to be applicable to the RFS system. This research was concerned with rectifying
  this gap in the existing knowledge. There were a number of different focal areas
  for this research. These included the surface texture of surfaces cut with hot tools,
  the effects of cutting strategy on the surface quality in single-pass cutting of
  foam, the effects of cutting strategy on the surface quality in multi-pass cutting,
  and the application of a current-control system to control the surface quality in
  real time during a cut. In each of the focal areas the goal was to develop a detailed
  understanding of the nature of the different aspects of surface quality, to map
  the factor interactions and dependencies that controlled these aspects of surface
  quality, to develop methods for predicting the expected surface quality based on
  cutting strategy (and vice versa) and to develop techniques for minimising the surface
  errors. The detailed investigation of the surface texture of surfaces produced with
  hot-tool cutting is presented in Chapter 4. This chapter explores the characteristic
  nature of foam surfaces, presents the development of a method of measuring the surface
  texture of foam, and investigates the usefulness of a range of standard texture
  parameters for assessing foam surface quality. It is concluded in this chapter that
  common texture parameters based on the relative heights of surface features are
  not capable of reliably discriminating between different foam surfaces, so a new
  texture parameter (the 10%-Height Contiguous Diameter) is developed and implemented.
  Using this parameter, it is possible to reliably predict the surface texture to
  be expected for a given set of cutting conditions. Investigations of the cutting
  strategy in single-pass cutting are presented in Chapter 5. This chapter identifies
  the two key aspects of surface quality in single-pass cutting, the kerfwidth and
  the surface barrelling. Experimental work is carried out to investigate the relationships
  between these errors and the cutting strategy, and the factors that influence each
  of them are identified. In addition, statistical models are developed for the kerf
  along the length of a cut so that the kerf can be predicted based on cutting conditions.
  This chapter also includes a study of the cutting force in single-pass cutting,
  and develops models that allow the prediction of the expected cutting force for
  a given cutting strategy. A detailed study of the cutting strategy for multi-pass
  cutting is presented in Chapter 6. This study identifies the most significant surface
  errors in multi-pass cutting and determines the causes of each of these errors and
  the factor interactions and dependencies that have to be considered when developing
  a multi-pass cutting strategy. Once again, statistical models that allow the prediction
  of these surface errors based on cutting strategy, or the evaluation of cutting
  strategy parameters to achieve a desired surface quality, are developed. The models
  for cutting force in single-pass cutting are applied to multi-pass cutting, and
  it is found that these models can accurately predict the force in multi-pass cutting
  as well. The characterisation of the acoustic output in hot-tool cutting forms the
  subject matter of Chapter 7. This study establishes that the magnitude of the acoustic
  output is proportional to the cutting force experienced during the cut, and is therefore
  potentially suitable for use as a trigger signal for feedback current control. This
  would allow an acoustic signal to be used instead of the current force signal, which
  has a number of drawbacks that will be discussed in Chapter 2, the Background Material
  chapter. The specific trigger signal identified as being of most use is the acoustic
  output in the 4 â€“ 12 kHz band, where the presence of any non-zero acoustic output
  above background noise is a reliable and repeatable indicator of the presence of
  thermomechanical cutting. The work presented in this thesis provides a detailed,
  quantitative, evidence-based and reliable understanding of the nature of the cutting
  strategy in hot-tool cutting of foam. The key cutting strategy parameters and the
  important aspects of surface quality for different cutting types are identified,
  the relationships between all these parameters are mapped, and quantitative models
  are developed that allow the output metrics like the surface quality or the cutting
  force to be predicted with a high degree of accuracy based on the input cutting
  strategy conditions. Armed with this understanding, it is possible to determine
  the most suitable cutting strategy for sculpting a given part, and to assess whether
  a given part can be sculpted with the RFS system. As such, the research problem
  posed at the start of this thesis has been largely solved, and the stage is set
  for further research to optimise the cutting strategy for sculpting different parts
  and to correct the remaining drawbacks of the RFS system to complete the development
  of a commercially-useful manufacturing system.
