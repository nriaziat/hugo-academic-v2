abstract: The book describes a new method known as L1 adaptive control for bringing
  linear system design methods into adaptive control to confront several open problems,
  including the selection and tuning of adaptation gains, guaranteed transient performance
  of both states and controls, and guaranteed robustness margins. Fast adaptation
  to allow aggressive maneuvering and recovery from failures is also confronted. A
  second key feature in L1 adaptive control is the use of a state-prediction system,
  whose dynamics can be prescribed and provide the reference model to be followed
  when the tracking and estimation errors are small. The third feature is the tuning
  of parameter estimates using projection methods. The block diagram of the resulting
  closed-loop adaptive system consists of linear components that can be analyzed using
  a mixture of linear frequency response techniques and adaptive control techniques.
