abstract: The heat transfer mechanism of tongue was investigated on the basis of experimental
  and theoretical research. Firstly, the relationship between tongue temperature and
  blood perfusion was obtained from animal experiment that mainly carried out on porcine
  tongue, subordinate on human tongue. Secondly, a one-dimensional variable coefficients
  second-order inhomogeneous heat transfer equation is developed by simplifying tongue
  as fin cube and the analytical solution is got. The results show that the change
  regulations of temperature by blood perfusion rate are the same in human and porcine
  tongue, and also, there is a good agreement between calculation and experimental
  results. When checking the model with corresponding properties of human tongue,
  the result is also satisfied. In conclusion, predicting temperature distribution
  of tongue is feasible with the fin cube model.
