 abstract = {The heat transfer mechanism of tongue was investigated on the basis of experimental and theoretical research. Firstly, the relationship between tongue temperature and blood perfusion was obtained from animal experiment that mainly carried out on porcine tongue, subordinate on human tongue. Secondly, a one-dimensional variable coefficients second-order inhomogeneous heat transfer equation is developed by simplifying tongue as fin cube and the analytical solution is got. The results show that the change regulations of temperature by blood perfusion rate are the same in human and porcine tongue, and also, there is a good agreement between calculation and experimental results. When checking the model with corresponding properties of human tongue, the result is also satisfied. In conclusion, predicting temperature distribution of tongue is feasible with the fin cube model.},
