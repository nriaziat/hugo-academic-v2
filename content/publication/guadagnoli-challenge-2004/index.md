abstract: 'The authors describe the effects of practice conditions in motor learning
  (e.g., contextual interference, knowledge of results) within the constraints of
  2 experimental variables: skill level and task difficulty. They use a research framework
  to conceptualize the interaction of those variables on the basis of concepts from
  information theory and information processing. The fundamental idea is that motor
  tasks represent different challenges for performers of different abilities. The
  authors propose that learning is related to the information arising from performance,
  which should be optimized along functions relating the difficulty of the task to
  the skill level of the performer. Specific testable hypotheses arising from the
  framework are also described.'
