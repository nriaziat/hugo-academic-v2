abstract: While energy devices are ubiquitous in the operating room, they remain poorly
  understood and can result in significant complications. The purpose of this study
  was to estimate the extent to which adding a novel bench-top component improves
  learning of SAGES’ Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy™ (FUSE) electrosurgery curriculum
  among surgical trainees.
