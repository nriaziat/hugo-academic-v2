 abstract = {While energy devices are ubiquitous in the operating room, they remain poorly understood and can result in significant complications. The purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which adding a novel bench-top component improves learning of SAGES’ Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy™ (FUSE) electrosurgery curriculum among surgical trainees.},
