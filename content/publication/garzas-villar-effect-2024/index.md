abstract: The provision of robotic assistance during motor training has proven to
  be effective in enhancing motor learning in some healthy trainee groups as well
  as patients. Personalizing such robotic assistance can help further improve motor
  (re)learning outcomes and cater better to the trainee's needs and desires. However,
  the development of personalized haptic assistance is hindered by the lack of understanding
  of the link between the trainee's personality and the effects of haptic guidance
  during human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we ran an experiment with 42
  healthy participants who trained with a robotic device to control a virtual pendulum
  to hit incoming targets either with or without haptic guidance. We found that certain
  personal traits affected how users adapt and interact with the guidance during training.
  In particular, those participants with an 'Achiever gaming style' performed better
  and applied lower interaction forces to the robotic device than the average participant
  as the training progressed. Conversely, participants with the 'Free spirit game
  style' increased the interaction force in the course of training. We also found
  an interaction between some personal characteristics and haptic guidance. Specifically,
  participants with a higher 'Transformation of challenge' trait exhibited poorer
  performance during training while receiving haptic guidance compared to an average
  participant receiving haptic guidance. Furthermore, individuals with an external
  Locus of Control tended to increase their interaction force with the device, deviating
  from the pattern observed in an average participant under the same guidance. These
  findings suggest that individual characteristics may play a crucial role in the
  effectiveness of haptic guidance training strategies.
