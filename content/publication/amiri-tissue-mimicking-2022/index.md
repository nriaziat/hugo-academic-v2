abstract: Emerging intraoperative tumor margin assessment techniques require the development
  of more complex and reliable organ phantoms to assess the performance of the technique
  before its translation into the clinic. In this work, electrically conductive tissue-mimicking
  materials (TMMs) based on fat, water and agar/gelatin were produced with tunable
  optical properties. The composition of the phantoms allowed for the assessment of
  tumor margins using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, as the fat/water ratio served
  as a discriminating factor between the healthy and malignant tissue. Moreover, the
  possibility of using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or transglutaminase in combination
  with fat, water and gelatin for developing TMMs was studied. The diffuse spectral
  response of the developed phantom materials had a good match with the spectral response
  of porcine muscle and adipose tissue, as well as in vitro human breast tissue. Using
  the developed recipe, anatomically relevant heterogeneous breast phantoms representing
  the optical properties of different layers of the human breast were fabricated using
  3D-printed molds. These TMMs can be used for further development of phantoms applicable
  for simulating the realistic breast conserving surgery workflow in order to evaluate
  the intraoperative optical-based tumor margin assessment techniques during electrosurgery.
