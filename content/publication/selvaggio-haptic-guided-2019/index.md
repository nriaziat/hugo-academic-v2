abstract: During suturing tasks performed with minimally invasive surgical robots,
  configuration singularities and joint limits often force surgeons to interrupt the
  task and re-grasp the needle using dual-arm movements. This yields an increased
  operator's cognitive load, time-to-completion and performance degradation. In this
  paper, we propose a haptic-guided shared control method for grasping the needle
  with the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM) of the da Vinci robot avoiding such issues.
  We suggest a cost function consisting of (i) the distance from robot joint limits
  and (ii) the task-oriented manipulability along the suturing trajectory. Evaluating
  the cost and its gradient on the needle grasping manifold allows us to obtain the
  optimal grasping pose for joint-limit and singularity free robot movements during
  suturing. We compute force cues and display them through the Master Tool Manipulator
  (MTM) to guide the surgeon towards the optimal grasp. As such, our system helps
  the operator to choose a grasping configuration that allows the robot to avoid joint
  limits and singularities during post-grasp suturing movements. We show the effectiveness
  of the proposed haptic-guided shared control method during suturing using both simulated
  and real experiments. The results illustrate that our approach significantly improves
  the performance in terms of needle re-grasping.
