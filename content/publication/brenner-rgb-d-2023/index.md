abstract: In the last decade, the computer vision field has seen significant progress
  in multimodal data fusion and learning, where multiple sensors, including depth,
  infrared, and visual, are used to capture the environment across diverse spectral
  ranges. Despite these advancements, there has been no systematic and comprehensive
  evaluation of fusing RGB-D and thermal modalities to date. While autonomous driving
  using LiDAR, radar, RGB, and other sensors has garnered substantial research interest,
  along with the fusion of RGB and depth modalities, the integration of thermal cameras
  and, specifically, the fusion of RGB-D and thermal data, has received comparatively
  less attention. This might be partly due to the limited number of publicly available
  datasets for such applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of both,
  state-of-the-art and traditional methods used in fusing RGB-D and thermal camera
  data for various applications, such as site inspection, human tracking, fault detection,
  and others. The reviewed literature has been categorised into technical areas, such
  as 3D reconstruction, segmentation, object detection, available datasets, and other
  related topics. Following a brief introduction and an overview of the methodology,
  the study delves into calibration and registration techniques, then examines thermal
  visualisation and 3D reconstruction, before discussing the application of classic
  feature-based techniques as well as modern deep learning approaches. The paper concludes
  with a discourse on current limitations and potential future research directions.
  It is hoped that this survey will serve as a valuable reference for researchers
  looking to familiarise themselves with the latest advancements and contribute to
  the RGB-DT research field.
