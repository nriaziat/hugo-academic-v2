abstract: 'This paper presents a review of the major haptic feedback teleoperation
  systems for micromanipulation. During the last decade, the handling of micrometer-sized
  objects has become a critical issue. Fields of application from material science
  to electronics demonstrate an urgent need for intuitive and flexible manipulation
  systems able to deal with small-scale industrial projects and assembly tasks. Two
  main approaches have been considered: fully automated tasks and manual operation.
  The first one require fully pre determined tasks, while the later necessitates highly
  trained operators. To overcome these issues the use of haptic feedback teleoperation
  where the user manipulates the tool through a joystick whilst feeling a force feedback,
  appears to be a promising solution as it allows high intuitiveness and flexibility.
  Major advances have been achieved during this last decade, starting with systems
  that enable the operator to feel the substrate topology, to the current state-of-the-art
  where 3D haptic feedback is provided to aid manipulation tasks. This paper details
  the major achievements and the solutions that have been developed to propose 3D
  haptic feedback for tools that often lack 3D force measurements. The use of virtual
  reality to enhance the immersion is also addressed. The strategies developed provide
  haptic feedback teleoperation systems with a high degree of assistance and for a
  wide range of micromanipulation tools. Based on this expertise on haptic for micromanipulation
  and virtual reality assistance it is now possible to propose microassembly systems
  for objects as small as 1 to 10 micrometers. This is a mature field and will benefit
  small-scale industrial projects where precision and flexibility in microassembly
  are required. © 2013 IEEE.'
