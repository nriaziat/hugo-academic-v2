 abstract = {Background Clinical robotic surgery systems do not currently provide haptic feedback because surgical instrument interactions are difÔ¨Åcult to measure and display. Our laboratory recently developed a technology that allows surgeons to feel and/or hear the high-frequency vibrations of robotic instruments as they interact with patient tissue and other tools. Until now, this type of feedback had not been carefully evaluated by users.},
