abstract: Background Clinical robotic surgery systems do not currently provide haptic
  feedback because surgical instrument interactions are difÔ¨Åcult to measure and display.
  Our laboratory recently developed a technology that allows surgeons to feel and/or
  hear the high-frequency vibrations of robotic instruments as they interact with
  patient tissue and other tools. Until now, this type of feedback had not been carefully
  evaluated by users.
