abstract: We present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for unknown input-afﬁne
  nonlinear dynamical systems. A non-parametric method is used to estimate the nonlinear
  dynamics from observed data. The estimated nonlinear dynamics are then linearized
  over time-varying regions of the state space to construct an Afﬁne Time-Varying
  (ATV) model. Error bounds arising from the estimation and linearization procedure
  are computed by using sampling techniques. The ATV model and the uncertainty sets
  are used to design a robust Model Predictive Controller (MPC) which guarantees safety
  for the unknown system with high probability. A simple nonlinear example demonstrates
  the effectiveness of the approach where commonly used estimation and linearization
  methods fail.
