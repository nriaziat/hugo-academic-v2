abstract: 'Objective: Virtual Reality (VR) simulators represent a remarkable educational
  opportunity in order to acquire and reﬁne surgical practical skills. Nevertheless,
  there exists no consensus regarding a standard curriculum of simulation-based training.
  This study introduces an automatic, adaptive curriculum where the training session
  is real-time scheduled on the basis of the trainee’s performances. Methods: An experimental
  study using the master console of the da Vinci Research Kit (Intuitive Surgical
  Inc., Sunnyvale, US) was carried out to test this approach. Tasks involving fundamental
  skills of robotic surgery were designed and simulated in VR. Twelve participants
  without medical background along with twelve medical residents were randomly and
  equally divided into two groups: a control group, self-managing the training session,
  and an experimental group, undergoing the proposed adaptive training. Results: The
  performances of the experimental users were signiﬁcantly better with respect to
  the ones of the control group after training (non-medical: p textless 0.01; medical:
  p = 0.02). This trend was analogous in the non-medical and medical populations and
  no signiﬁcant difference was identiﬁed between these two classes (even in the baseline
  assessment). Conclusion: The analysis of the learning of the involved surgical skills
  highlighted how the proposed adaptive training managed to better identify and compensate
  for the trainee’s gaps. The absence of initial difference between the non-medical
  and medical users underlines that robotic surgical devices require speciﬁc training
  before clinical practice. Signiﬁcance: This feasibility study could pave the way
  towards the improvement of simulation-based training curricula.'
