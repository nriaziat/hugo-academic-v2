 abstract = {Accurate reproduction of the preoperative plan at the time of surgery is critical for wide resection of primary bone tumors. Robotic technology can potentially help the surgeon reproduce a given preoperative plan, but yielding control of cutting instruments to a robot introduces potentially serious complications. We developed a novel passive (“haptics”) robot-assisted resection technique for primary bone sarcomas that takes advantage of robotic accuracy while still leaving control of the cutting instrument in the hands of the surgeon.},
