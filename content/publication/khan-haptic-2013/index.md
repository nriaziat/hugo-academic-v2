abstract: Accurate reproduction of the preoperative plan at the time of surgery is
  critical for wide resection of primary bone tumors. Robotic technology can potentially
  help the surgeon reproduce a given preoperative plan, but yielding control of cutting
  instruments to a robot introduces potentially serious complications. We developed
  a novel passive (“haptics”) robot-assisted resection technique for primary bone
  sarcomas that takes advantage of robotic accuracy while still leaving control of
  the cutting instrument in the hands of the surgeon.
