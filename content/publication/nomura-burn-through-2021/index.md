abstract: In a single bevel GMAW (gas metal arc welding) with gap fluctuation, a deep
  learning model was constructed using the monitoring image during the welding to
  predict the welding quality. We utilized Python and the library Keras and created
  a CNN (Convolutional neural network) model using the top surface image including
  the molten pool as an input. The classification model was used to predict the burn-through,
  and the regression model was used to estimate the penetration depth. As a result,
  the excessive penetration and burn-through could be predicted in advance and more
  than 95 % of estimated results of penetration depth were less 1 mm error for stepped
  and tapered sample shapes.
