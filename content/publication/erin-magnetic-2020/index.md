abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system–driven medical robotics is an emerging
  field that aims to use clinical MRI systems not only for medical imaging but also
  for actuation, localization, and control of medical robots. Submillimeter scale
  resolution of MR images for soft tissues combined with the electromagnetic gradient
  coil–based magnetic actuation available inside MR scanners can enable theranostic
  applications of medical robots for precise image-guided minimally invasive interventions.
  MRI-driven robotics typically does not introduce new MRI instrumentation for actuation
  but instead focuses on converting already available instrumentation for robotic
  purposes. To use the advantages of this technology, various medical devices such
  as untethered mobile magnetic robots and tethered active catheters have been designed
  to be powered magnetically inside MRI systems. Herein, the state-of-the-art progress,
  challenges, and future directions of MRI-driven medical robotic systems are reviewed.
