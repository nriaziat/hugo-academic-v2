abstract: In a previous study, we found that haptic guidance from a robotic steering
  wheel can improve short-term learning of steering of a simulated vehicle, in contrast
  to several studies of other tasks that had found that the guidance either impairs
  or does not aid motor learning. In this study, we examined whether haptic guidance-as-needed
  can improve long-term retention (across 1 week) of the steering task, with age and
  initial skill level as independent variables. Training with guidance-as-needed allowed
  all participants to learn to steer without experiencing large errors. For young
  participants (age 18–30), training with guidance-as-needed produced better long-term
  retention of driving skill than did training without guidance. For older participants
  (age 65–92), training with guidance-as-needed improved long-term retention in tracking
  error, but not significantly. However, for a subset of less skilled, older subjects,
  training with guidance-as-needed significantly improved long-term retention. The
  benefits of guidance-based training were most evident as an improved ability to
  straighten the vehicle direction when coming out of turns. In general, older participants
  not only systematically performed worse at the task than younger subjects (errors
  ∼3 times greater), but also apparently learned more slowly, forgetting a greater
  percentage of the learned task during the 1 week layoffs between the  experimental
  sessions. This study demonstrates that training with haptic guidance can benefit
  long-term retention of a driving skill for young and for some old drivers. Training
  with haptic guidance is more useful for people with less initial skill.
