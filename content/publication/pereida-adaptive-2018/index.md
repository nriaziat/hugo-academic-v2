abstract: Robots and automated systems are increasingly being introduced to unknown
  and dynamic environments where they are required to handle disturbances, unmodeled
  dynamics, and parametric uncertainties. Robust and adaptive control strategies are
  required to achieve high performance in these dynamic environments. In this paper,
  we propose a novel adaptive model predictive controller that combines model predictive
  control (MPC) with an underlying L1 adaptive controller to improve trajectory tracking
  of a system subject to unknown and changing disturbances. The L1 adaptive controller
  forces the system to behave in a predefined way, as specified by a reference model.
  A higher-level model predictive controller then uses this reference model to calculate
  the optimal reference input based on a cost function, while taking into account
  input and state constraints. We focus on the experimental validation of the proposed
  approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments on a quadrotor. We show
  that the proposed approach has a lower trajectory tracking error compared to non-predictive,
  adaptive approaches and a predictive, nonadaptive approach, even when external wind
  disturbances are applied.
