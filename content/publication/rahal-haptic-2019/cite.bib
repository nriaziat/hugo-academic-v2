 abstract = {Robot-assisted cutting is considered an important task in several fields, such as robotic surgery, nuclear decommissioning, waste management, and manufacturing. Despite the complex dexterity requirements of cutting tasks, very simple mechanically-linked master-slave manipulators still dominate many of the above fields (e.g., nuclear robotics). Moreover, even when more dexterous manipulators are available (e.g., in robot-assisted surgery), the employed systems show little or no autonomy, delegating all control to the experience of the human operator. To ameliorate this situation, we present two haptic shared-control approaches for robotic cutting. They are designed to assist the human operator by enforcing different nonholonomic-like constraints representative of the cutting kinematics. To validate our approach, we carried out a human-subject experiment in a real cutting scenario. We compared our shared-control techniques with each other and with a standard haptic teleoperation scheme. Results show the usefulness of assisted control schemes in complex applications such as cutting. However, they also show a discrepancy between objective and subjective metrics.},
