abstract: Tele-operation of robotic surgery reduces the radiation exposure during
  the interventional radiological operations. However, endoscope vision without force
  feedback on the surgical tool increases the difficulty for precise manipulation
  and the risk of tissue damage. The shared control of vision and force provides a
  novel approach of enhanced control with haptic guidance, which could lead to subtle
  dexterity and better maneuvrability during MIS surgery.
