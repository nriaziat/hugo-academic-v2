abstract: This paper describes a novel approach to capsular endoscopy that takes advantage
  of active magnetic locomotion in the gastrointestinal tract guided by an anthropomorphic
  robotic arm. Simulations were performed to select the design parameters allowing
  an effective and reliable magnetic link between the robot end-effector (endowed
  with a permanent magnet) and the capsular device (endowed with small permanent magnets).
  In order to actively monitor the robotic endoluminal system and to efficiently perform
  diagnostic and surgical medical procedures, a feedback control based on inertial
  sensing was also implemented. The proposed platform demonstrated to be a reliable
  solution to move and steer a capsular device in a slightly insufflated gastrointestinal
  lumen. Â© 2009 Cambridge University Press.
