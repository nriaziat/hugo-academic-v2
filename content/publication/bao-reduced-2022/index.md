abstract: Well-selected power with accurate delivery is of importance in electrosurgery
  to generate proper temperature at the cutting site, and thus, reduce undesired collateral
  tissue damages. Conventional electrosurgery generator (ESG) targets tracking a preset
  power, manually set by surgeons per their experience before the surgery, with high
  accurate delivery. It is possible that this fixed power setting is not at the optimal
  point and, thus, increases the possibility of added-collateral biomedical tissue
  damage. To eliminate the potential negative impact of the fixed and ill-suited power
  setting, a real-time feedback control scheme is outlined in this article to adjust
  the preset power of the ESG to create an adaptive power reference, which is then
  tracked using an experimental high-frequency inverter (HFI) that enables electrosurgery
  with a fundamental (sinusoidal) output frequency of 390 kHz. Subsequently, experiments
  using the gallium nitride (GaN)-based HFI are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy
  of the new variable-power approach over the conventional fixed power approach in
  terms of collateral tissue damage reduction.
