abstract: 'Introduction: Magnet-assisted surgery is a new platform within minimally
  invasive surgery. The Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System, the first magnetic surgical
  system to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, includes a deployable,
  magnetic grasper and an external magnet that is used to manipulate the grasper within
  the peritoneal cavity. This system is currently approved for patients undergoing
  laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a body mass index (BMI) between 21 and 34 kg/m
  2 . Herein, we detail the first United States experience with the Levita™ Magnetic
  Surgical System during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: The Levita™ Magnetic
  Surgical System was used on consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy
  at our institution from June 2016 through November 2016. Only patients undergoing
  elective surgery and those with a body mass index (BMI) between 21 and 34 kg/m 2
  were included. Baseline patient characteristics, operative time, and perioperative
  details were collected. Results: A total of ten patients underwent laparoscopic
  cholecystectomy with the Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System during the defined study
  period. The mean age at the time of surgery was 49.0 years and the average BMI of
  the cohort was 27.6 kg/m 2 . The average operative time was 64.4 min. There were
  no perioperative complications. Seven (70.0%) patients were discharged to home on
  the day of surgery, while the remaining three (30.0%) patients were discharged to
  home on postoperative day number one. Surgeons reported that the magnetic grasper
  was easy to use and provided adequate tissue retraction and exposure. Conclusions:
  The Levita™ Magnetic Surgical System is safe and feasible to use in patients undergoing
  laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Routine use of this system may facilitate a reduction
  in the total number of laparoscopic trocars used, leading to less tissue trauma
  and improved cosmesis. Additional studies are needed to determine the applicability
  and utility of this system for other general surgery cases.'
