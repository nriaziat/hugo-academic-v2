abstract: Teleoperated robotic systems have introduced more intuitive control for
  minimally invasive surgery, but the optimal method for training remains unknown.
  Recent motor learning studies have demonstrated that exaggeration of errors helps
  trainees learn to perform tasks with greater speed and accuracy. We hypothesized
  that training in a force field that pushes the operator away from a desired path
  would improve their performance on a virtual reality ring-on-wire task. Forty surgical
  novices trained under a no-force, guidance, or error-amplifying force field over
  five days. Completion time, translational and rotational path error, and combined
  error-time were evaluated under no force field on the final day. The groups significantly
  differed in combined error-time, with the guidance group performing the worst. Error-amplifying
  field participants showed the most improvement and did not plateau in their performance
  during training, suggesting that learning was still ongoing. Guidance field participants
  had the worst performance on the final day, confirming the guidance hypothesis.
  Participants with high initial path error benefited more from guidance. Participants
  with high initial combined error-time benefited more from guidance and error-amplifying
  force field training. Our results suggest that error-amplifying and error-reducing
  haptic training for robot-assisted telesurgery benefits trainees of different abilities
  differently.
