abstract: 'The use of robots has attracted researchers to design numerous haptic training
  methods to support motor learning. However, investigations of new methods yielded
  inconclusive results regarding their effectiveness to enhance learning due to the
  diversity of tasks, haptic designs, participants’ skill level, and study protocols.
  In this review, we developed a taxonomy to identify generalizable ﬁndings out of
  publications on haptic training. In the taxonomy, we grouped the results of studies
  on healthy learners based on participants’ skill level and tasks’ characteristics.
  Our inspection of included studies revealed that: i) Performance-enhancing haptic
  methods were beneﬁcial for novices, ii) Training with haptics was as effective as
  training with other feedback modalities, and iii) Performance-enhancing and performance-degrading
  haptic methods were useful for the learning of temporal and spatial aspects, respectively.
  We also observed that these ﬁndings are in line with results from robotaided neurorehabilitation
  studies on patients. Our review suggests that haptic training can be effective to
  foster learning, especially when the information cannot be provided with other feedback
  modalities. We believe the ﬁndings from the taxonomy constitute a general guide,
  which can assist researchers when designing studies to investigate the effectiveness
  of haptics on learning different tasks. Index Terms—Augmented haptic feedback, motor
  learning and neurorehabilitation, motor task classiﬁcation, robot-assisted training,
  skill level, taxonomy.'
