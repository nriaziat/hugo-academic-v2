 abstract = {The use of robots has attracted researchers to design numerous haptic training methods to support motor learning. However, investigations of new methods yielded inconclusive results regarding their effectiveness to enhance learning due to the diversity of tasks, haptic designs, participants’ skill level, and study protocols. In this review, we developed a taxonomy to identify generalizable ﬁndings out of publications on haptic training. In the taxonomy, we grouped the results of studies on healthy learners based on participants’ skill level and tasks’ characteristics. Our inspection of included studies revealed that: i) Performance-enhancing haptic methods were beneﬁcial for novices, ii) Training with haptics was as effective as training with other feedback modalities, and iii) Performance-enhancing and performance-degrading haptic methods were useful for the learning of temporal and spatial aspects, respectively. We also observed that these ﬁndings are in line with results from robotaided neurorehabilitation studies on patients. Our review suggests that haptic training can be effective to foster learning, especially when the information cannot be provided with other feedback modalities. We believe the ﬁndings from the taxonomy constitute a general guide, which can assist researchers when designing studies to investigate the effectiveness of haptics on learning different tasks. Index Terms—Augmented haptic feedback, motor learning and neurorehabilitation, motor task classiﬁcation, robot-assisted training, skill level, taxonomy.},
