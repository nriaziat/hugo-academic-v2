abstract: The Intuitive da Vinci system enables surgeons to see and manipulate structures
  deep within the body via tiny incisions. Though the robotic tools mimic oneâ€™s hand
  motions, surgeons cannot feel what the tools are touching, a striking contrast to
  non-robotic techniques. We have developed a new method for partially restoring this
  lost sense of touch. Our VerroTouch system measures the vibrations caused by tool
  contact and immediately recreates them on the master handles for the surgeon to
  feel. This augmentation enables the surgeon to feel the texture of rough surfaces,
  the start and end of contact with manipulated objects, and other important tactile
  events. While it does not provide low frequency forces, we believe vibrotactile
  feedback will be highly useful for surgical task execution, a hypothesis we we will
  test in future work.
