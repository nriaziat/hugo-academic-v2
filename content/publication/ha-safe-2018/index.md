abstract: Surgical energy injuries are an underappreciated phenomenon. Improper use
  of surgical energy or poor attention to patient safety can result in operating room
  fires, tissue injuries, and interferences with other electronic devices, while rare
  complications can be devastatingly severe. Despite this, there is no current standard
  requirement for educating surgeons on the safe use of energy-based devices or evaluation
  of electrosurgery (ES) education in residency training, credentialing, or practice.
  The study aimed to assess the current baseline knowledge of surgeons and surgical
  trainees with regards to ES across varying experiences at a tertiary level care
  center.
