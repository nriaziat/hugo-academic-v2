abstract: An isotherm migration method is presented to track the isotherms at the
  surface of a semi-infinite workpiece that is being heated by a point source with
  a linear motion. The governing heat conduction equation is first transformed into
  a one-dimensional isotherm migration equation in spherical coordinates, which expresses
  the isotherm velocities as a function of the isotherm positions and their temperature
  derivatives. A finite difference formulation of this equation is then derived together
  with the corresponding boundary conditions. It is shown through a number of simulations
  that this system converges to the analytical solution when the temperature mesh
  is refined. The additional presence of a phase change results in a Stefan problem
  that can be solved approximately with some minor modifications to the method. The
  resulting system of equations can be used as a simple but accurate thermal model
  for some laser-material interaction processes such as laser heat treatments and
  laser cladding.
