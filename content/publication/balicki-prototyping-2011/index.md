abstract: This paper presents the design of a tele-robotic microsurgical platform
  designed for development of cooperative and tele-operative control schemes, sensor
  based smart instruments, user interfaces and new surgical techniques with eye surgery
  as the driving application. The system is built using the distributed component-based
  cisst libraries and the Surgical Assistant Workstation framework. It includes a
  cooperatively controlled EyeRobot2, a da Vinci Master manipulator, and a remote
  stereo visualization system. We use constrained optimization based virtual fixture
  control to provide Virtual Remote-Center-of-Motion (vRCM) and haptic feedback. Such
  system can be used in a hybrid setup, combining local cooperative control with remote
  tele-operation, where an experienced surgeon can provide hand-over-hand tutoring
  to a novice user. In another scheme, the system can provide haptic feedback based
  on virtual fixtures constructed from real-time force and proximity sensor information.
