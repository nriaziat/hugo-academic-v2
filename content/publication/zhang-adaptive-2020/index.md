abstract: In order to improve the spatial resolution of an optical micro-scanning
  thermal microscope system, the micro-scanning position must be accurately calibrated.
  An adaptive calibration method based on image registration and plane coordinate
  system is proposed. The meaning of calibration is given, and the principle and method
  of point calibration are introduced in detail and experiments using the real system
  were done. Different reconstruction methods were applied to reconstruct the visible
  light image and the real thermal microscope image, and the evaluation scores are
  given. Results of simulation and real thermal imaging processing show that the method
  can successfully calibrate the micro-scanning position. The method can significantly
  improve the oversampled reconstructed image quality, thus enhancing the spatial
  resolution of the system. This method can also be used in other electro-optical
  imaging systems.
