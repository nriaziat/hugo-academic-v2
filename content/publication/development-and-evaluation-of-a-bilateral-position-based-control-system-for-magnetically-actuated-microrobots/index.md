  We present a bilateral teleoperation system ca-
  pable of controlling magnetically-actuated microrobots. Our
  system is built on the previously-developed MagnetoSuture
  system, which uses remote-controlled magnetic fields to per-
  form tetherless tissue suturing with sintered Neodymium Iron
  Boron (NdFeB) suture needles. Improving upon the original
  MagnetoSuture control interface, which uses a standard 2-
  degree-of-freedom (DoF) gamepad, our approach uses a kines-
  thetic haptic device (the 3D Systems Geomagic Touch) as a
  control interface. This force-reflecting, position-based controller
  is intended to improve the intuitiveness of the MagnetoSuture
  control interface by offering greater environmental awareness
  through kinesthetic feedback. Here we discuss the design and
  architecture of this control strategy, including detailed analysis
  of the magnetic dipole model based control, and evaluate the
  efficacy of this control interface in navigating through a custom
  maze. Our pilot study results suggest that this control interface
  is as intuitive to use as the standard gamepad, and may be
  the preferred control interface for some users. From these
  findings, we are working towards 1) testing haptic performance
  in occluded settings, akin to microbot guidance and control
  over MRI, 2) enhancing the traditional PID controller with
  numerical magnetic force models, and 3) testing with more
  complex mazes.
