abstract: "We present a bilateral teleoperation method capable of controlling
  magnetic microrobots. Our method is built on the MagnetoSuture, a quad-coil
  magnetic actuation system which controls magnetic fields to perform tetherless
  tissue suturing with sintered Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) suture needles.
  While under visually rich conditions, we found that haptic feedback preference
  varies greatly, many magnetic robot procedures are conduced under slow, highly
  corrupted or otherwise severely limited visual feedback, such as MRI, CT
  Scans, and fluoroscopy.  Here we discuss the design and architecture of this
  teleportation strategy, including detailed technical analysis of the FEM-based
  control method, Tikhonov regularization for improving performance under
  ill-posed conditions, EMI-resistant online force measurement, and fluoroscopy
  simulations for user studies. We also evaluate the efficacy of this control
  method in a mock aneurysm coiling task and discuss measures indicating both
  task performance and neurological performance. "
