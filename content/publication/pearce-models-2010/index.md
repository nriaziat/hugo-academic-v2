abstract: Irreversible thermal alterations in tissue function and structure are used
  in clinical applications to achieve diverse goals, from lower-temperature tumor
  ablation to higher-temperature tissue fusion and surgical cutting. The typical formulation
  in tumor hyperthermia studies, the thermal iso-effect dose, derives from cell-survival
  studies but describes a single process only over a limited range of temperatures
  and is thus not suitable for multiple higher-temperature events. Many other thermal
  damage processes have been described using the Arrhenius kinetic rate of formation
  approach, which has the advantage that it is inherently quantitative in nature and
  can easily be compared with quantitative markers of injury or histologic section.
  The vast majority of Arrhenius studies have been directed toward measurable cellular
  effects at relatively low temperatures. Some emphasis in this paper has been placed
  on what is known of higher-temperature processes to support the theme of this issue.
  This review compares and contrasts the two thermal-damage formulations and reviews
  methods to convert between them.
