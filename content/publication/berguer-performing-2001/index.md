abstract: "Background: The awkward visual and physical interface of video-endoscopic
  surgery (VES) has been shown to increase the physical workload of the surgeon, yet
  there is a lack of objective information on the mental effort and stress demanded
  by VES techniques. This study addresses the hypothesis that VES is more stressful
  than open surgery using an ergonomic analysis of surgical tasks in a laboratory
  setting. Methods: A portable ergonomic work station was developed using a software
  Virtual Instrument (VI) interfaced with electronic hardware to compare the mental
  workload of 28 surgeons. The task was knot tying. The independent variable was work
  condition: rest, open technique, or VES technique. Dependent variables were tonic
  skin conductance level (SCL), electrooculogram (EOG), and subjective reports of
  concentration (CON) and stress (STR). Statistical analysis used nonparametric methods.
  Results: Subjects tied fewer knots using the VES technique (p textless0.05). The
  SCL increased progressively from rest to the open task to the VES task (p textless0.05),
  correlating with the subjects' reported increase in mental stress level (p textless0.05).
  Eye blinks decreased from rest to the open task (p textless0.05), consistent with
  the subjects' reported increase in level of mental concentration. From the open
  to the VES task, eye blinks increased (p textless0.05), as would be expected given
  the greater demands of the VES task. Experienced subjects demonstrated less variability
  in SCL levels across tasks. Conclusions: VES technique requires greater concentration
  and places greater mental stress on surgeons than to open surgery. More experience
  with VES may decrease this effect. Studies are needed to improve the human-technology
  interface the stress."
