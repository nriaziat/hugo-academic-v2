 abstract = {Reasoning about a scene’s thermal signature, in addition to its visual appearance and spatial conﬁguration, would facilitate signiﬁcant advances in perceptual systems. Applications involving the segmentation and tracking of persons, vehicles, and other heat-emitting objects, for example, could beneﬁt tremendously from even coarsely accurate relative temperatures. With the increasing affordability of commercially available thermal cameras, as well as the imminent introduction of new, mobile form factors, such data will be readily and widely accessible. However, in order for thermal processing to complement existing methods in RGBD, there must be an effective procedure for calibrating RGBD and thermal cameras to create RGBDT (red, green, blue, depth, and thermal) data. In this paper, we present an automatic method for the synchronization and calibration of RGBD and thermal cameras in arbitrary environments. While traditional calibration methods fail in our multimodal setting, we leverage invariant features visible by both camera types. We ﬁrst synchronize the streams with a simple optimization procedure that aligns their motion statistic time series. We then ﬁnd the relative poses of the cameras by minimizing an objective that measures the alignment between edge maps from the two streams. In contrast to existing methods that use special calibration targets with key points visible to both cameras, our method requires nothing more than some edges visible to both cameras, such as those arising from humans. We evaluate our method and demonstrate that it consistently converges to the correct transform and that it results in high-quality RGBDT data.},
