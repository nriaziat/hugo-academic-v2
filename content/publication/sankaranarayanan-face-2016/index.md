abstract: Electrosurgery is a modality that is widely used in surgery, whose use has
  resulted in injuries, OR fires and even death. The SAGES has established the FUSE
  program to address the knowledge gap in the proper and safe usage of electrosurgical
  devices. Complementing it, we have developed the Virtual Electrosurgery Skill Trainer
  (VEST©), which is designed to train subjects in both cognitive and motor skills
  necessary to safely operate electrosurgical devices. The objective of this study
  is to asses the face validity of the VEST© simulator.
