title: Investigating Haptic Feedback in Vision-Deficient Millirobot Telemanipulation
subtitle: ""
doi: 10.1109/LRA.2024.3397529
abstract: The evolution of magnetically actuated millirobots gives rise to
  unique teleoperation challenges due to their non-traditional kinematic and
  dynamic architectures, as well as their frequent use of suboptimal imaging
  modalities. Recent investigations into haptic interfaces for millirobots have
  shown promise but lack the clinically motivated task scenarios necessary to
  justify future development. In this work, we investigate the utility of haptic
  feedback on bilateral teleoperation of a magnetically actuated millirobot in
  visually deficient conditions. We conducted an N=23 user study in an aneurysm
  coiling inspired procedure, which required participants to navigate the robot
  through a maze in near total darkness to manipulate beads to a target under
  simulated fluoroscopy. We hypothesized that users will be better able to
  complete the telemanipulation task with haptic feedback while reducing excess
  forces on their surroundings compared to the no feedback conditions. Our
  results showed an over 40% improvement in participants' bead scoring, a nearly
  10% reduction in mean force, and 13% reduction in maximum force with haptic
  feedback, as well as significant improvements in other metrics. Results
  highlight that benefits of haptic feedback are retained when haptic feedback
  is removed. These findings suggest that haptic feedback has the potential to
  significantly improve millirobot telemanipulation and control in traditionally
  vision deficient tasks.
