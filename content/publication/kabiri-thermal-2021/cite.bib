 abstract = {In this paper, a closed-form analytical solution of hyperbolic Pennes bioheat equation is obtained for spatial evolution of temperature distributions during moving laser thermotherapy of the skin and kidney tissues. The three-dimensional cubic homogeneous perfused biological tissue is adopted as a media and the Gaussian distributed function in surface and exponentially distributed in depth is used for modeling of laser moving heat source. The solution procedure is Eigen value method which leads to a closed form solution. The effect of moving velocity, perfusion rate, laser intensity, absorption and scattering coefficients, and thermal relaxation time on temperature profiles and tissue thermal damage are investigated. Results are illustrated that the moving velocity and the perfusion rate of the tissues are the main important parameters in produced temperatures under moving heat source. The higher perfusion rate of kidney compared with skin may lead to lower induced temperature amplitude in moving path of laser due to the convective role of the perfusion term. Furthermore, the analytical solution can be a powerful tool for analysis and optimization of practical treatment in the clinical setting and laser procedure therapeutic applications and can be used for verification of other numerical heating models.},
