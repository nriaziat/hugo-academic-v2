abstract: In this paper, a closed-form analytical solution of hyperbolic Pennes bioheat
  equation is obtained for spatial evolution of temperature distributions during moving
  laser thermotherapy of the skin and kidney tissues. The three-dimensional cubic
  homogeneous perfused biological tissue is adopted as a media and the Gaussian distributed
  function in surface and exponentially distributed in depth is used for modeling
  of laser moving heat source. The solution procedure is Eigen value method which
  leads to a closed form solution. The effect of moving velocity, perfusion rate,
  laser intensity, absorption and scattering coefficients, and thermal relaxation
  time on temperature profiles and tissue thermal damage are investigated. Results
  are illustrated that the moving velocity and the perfusion rate of the tissues are
  the main important parameters in produced temperatures under moving heat source.
  The higher perfusion rate of kidney compared with skin may lead to lower induced
  temperature amplitude in moving path of laser due to the convective role of the
  perfusion term. Furthermore, the analytical solution can be a powerful tool for
  analysis and optimization of practical treatment in the clinical setting and laser
  procedure therapeutic applications and can be used for verification of other numerical
  heating models.
