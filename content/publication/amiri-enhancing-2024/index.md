abstract: "Objective: Detecting the cancerous growth margin and achieving a negative
  margin is one of the challenges that surgeons face during cancer procedures. A smart
  electrosurgical knife with integrated optical fibers has been designed previously
  to enable real-time use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for intraoperative margin
  assessment. In this paper, the thermal effect of the electrosurgical knife on tissue
  sensing is investigated. Methods: Porcine tissues and phantoms were used to investigate
  the performance of the smart electrosurgical knife after electrosurgery. The fat-to-water
  content ratio (F/W-ratio) served as the discriminative parameter for distinguishing
  tissues and tissue mimicking phantoms with varying fat content. The F/W-ratio of
  tissues and phantoms was measured with the smart electrosurgical knife before and
  after 14 minutes of electrosurgery. Additionally, a layered porcine tissue and phantom
  were sliced and measured from top to bottom with the smart electrosurgical knife.
  Results: Mapping the thermal activity of the electrosurgical knife's electrode during
  animal tissue electrosurgery revealed temperatures exceeding 400Â°C. Electrosurgery
  for 14 minutes had no impact on the device's accurate detection of the F/W-ratio.
  The smart electrosurgical knife enables real-time tissue detection and predicts
  the fat content of the next layer from 4 mm ahead. Conclusion: The design of the
  smart electrosurgical knife outlined in this paper demonstrates its potential utility
  for tissue detection during electrosurgery. Significance: In the future, the smart
  electrosurgical knife could be a valuable intraoperative margin assessment tool,
  aiding surgeons in detecting tumor borders and achieving negative margins."
