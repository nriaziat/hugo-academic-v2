abstract: This article provides the results of a survey on electrosurgical complications
  and surgical techniques during laparoscopy from the American College of Surgeons.
  Of the respondents, 18% stated that they had personally experienced an electrosurgical
  burn to their patient during laparoscopy. The survey shows that the majority of
  surgeons, 74%, employ coagulation mode most commonly during surgery. Of the surgeons,
  more than one third routinely employ high-voltage coagulation and blend mode operation
  at power settings textgreater 40 W. We discuss the possible complications that may
  occur from high-voltage-high-power settings, such as direct coupling, insulation
  failure, and capacitive coupling of unintended current into internal tissue such
  as bowel. We further describe techniques that may be employed to minimize the likelihood
  of unintended electrosurgical burns as well as technologies that can eliminate or
  greatly decrease the likelihood of electrosurgical complications.
