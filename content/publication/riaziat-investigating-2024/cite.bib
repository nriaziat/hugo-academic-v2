 abstract = {The evolution of magnetically actuated millirobots gives rise to unique teleoperation challenges due to their non-traditional kinematic and dynamic architectures, as well as their frequent use of suboptimal imaging modalities. Recent investigations into haptic interfaces for millirobots have shown promise but lack the clinically motivated task scenarios necessary to justify future development. In this work, we investigate the utility of haptic feedback on bilateral teleoperation of a magnetically actuated millirobot in visually deficient conditions. We conducted an N = 23 user study in an aneurysm coiling inspired procedure, which required participants to navigate the robot through a maze in near total darkness to manipulate beads to a target under simulated fluoroscopy. We hypothesized that users will be better able to complete the telemanipulation task with haptic feedback while reducing excess forces on their surroundings compared to the no feedback conditions. Our results showed an over 40% improvement in participants' bead scoring, a nearly 10% reduction in mean force, and 13% reduction in maximum force with haptic feedback, as well as significant improvements in other metrics. Results highlight that benefits of haptic feedback are retained when haptic feedback is removed. These findings suggest that haptic feedback has the potential to significantly improve millirobot telemanipulation and control in traditionally vision deficient tasks.},
