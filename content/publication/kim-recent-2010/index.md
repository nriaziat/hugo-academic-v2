abstract: It is well known that an origin of MPC is the controller in adaptive control
  scheme. In other words, MPC is popularly employed as the control law in adaptive
  control. In primitive adaptive MPC, constraints are not taken into account. However,
  after this adaptive MPC, tremendous progress has been made in MPC theory independently
  in a way that various constraints on the state and input variables are considered
  and closed loop stability is guaranteed. Ironically, it turns out that such a well
  developed MPC suffers from being employed as the control law in adaptive control
  scheme because it is difÔ¨Åcult to guarantee closed loop stability when the MPC is
  combined with adaptation algorithm and feasibility at all times owing to estimated
  parameters. This paper presents several important issues in the problem of adaptive
  MPC and introduces recent results and future work.
