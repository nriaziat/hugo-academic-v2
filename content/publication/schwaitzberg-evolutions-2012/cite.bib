 abstract = {There is an unquestionable need for an organized surgical curriculum concerned with the application of energy in the surgical or endoscopic field. This is driven by a number of factors that are evolving rapidly, not the least of which are the technological choices themselves which are addressed in detail throughout this manual. The Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE) represents an opportunity to address the changes brought about by the interactions of the evolutions and revolutions in technology, patient safety, surgical training, credentialing and societal expectations. While revolutionary in concept, the FUSE program itself will grow to accommodate more devices and more technologies over time. By building a scalable framework, our understanding, competency, and expertise in the use of surgical energy will evolve in a synchronous fashion with the technology.},
