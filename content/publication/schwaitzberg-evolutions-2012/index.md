abstract: There is an unquestionable need for an organized surgical curriculum concerned
  with the application of energy in the surgical or endoscopic field. This is driven
  by a number of factors that are evolving rapidly, not the least of which are the
  technological choices themselves which are addressed in detail throughout this manual.
  The Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE) represents an opportunity to address
  the changes brought about by the interactions of the evolutions and revolutions
  in technology, patient safety, surgical training, credentialing and societal expectations.
  While revolutionary in concept, the FUSE program itself will grow to accommodate
  more devices and more technologies over time. By building a scalable framework,
  our understanding, competency, and expertise in the use of surgical energy will
  evolve in a synchronous fashion with the technology.
