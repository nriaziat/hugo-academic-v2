abstract: Hands-on training is an indispensable part of surgical practice. As the
  tools used in the operating room become more intricate, the demand for efficient
  training methods increases. This work proposes a robotic assistance-as-needed method
  for training with surgical teleoperated robots. The method adapts the intensity
  of the assistance according to the trainee's current and past performance while
  gradually increasing the level of control of the trainee as the training progresses.
  The work includes an experiment comprising 160 acquisition sessions from 16 novice
  subjects performing a bimanual teleoperated exercise with a da Vinci Research Kit
  surgical console. Results capture the subtleties in the task's learning curve with
  and without robotic assistance and hint at the potential of robotic assistance for
  complex visuomotor training. Although robotic assistance for motor learning has
  received mixed results that range from beneficial to detrimental effects, this study
  shows such assistance may increase the rate of learning of certain skills in complex
  motor tasks.
