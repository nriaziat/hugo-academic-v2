abstract: We demonstrate five-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) wireless magnetic control
  of a fully untethered microrobot (3-DOF position and 2-DOF pointing orientation).
  The microrobot can move through a large workspace and is completely unrestrained
  in the rotation DOF. We accomplish this level of wireless control with an electromagnetic
  system that we call OctoMag. OctoMag's unique abilities are due to its utilization
  of complex nonuniform magnetic fields, which capitalizes on a linear representation
  of the coupled field contributions of multiple soft-magnetic-core electromagnets
  acting in concert. OctoMag was primarily designed to control intraocular microrobots
  for delicate retinal procedures, but it also has potential uses in other medical
  applications or micromanipulation under an optical microscope.
