abstract: Compared with 2D thermal images, visualizing the temperature of objects
  with their corresponding 3D surfaces provides a more intuitive way to perceive the
  environment. In this paper, we present an integrated system for largescale and real-time
  3D thermographic reconstruction through fusion of visible, infrared and depth images.
  The system is composed of an RGB-D and a thermal camera, whose image measurements
  are aligned with respect to the same coordinate frame. A thermal direct method based
  on infrared features is proposed and integrated into state-of-art localization algorithms
  for generating reliable 3D thermal point clouds. The reported experimental results
  demonstrate that our approach can be used for 3D reconstruction of small and large
  scale environments based on dual spectrum 3D information.
